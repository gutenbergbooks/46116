PREFACE
</p>

<p>
In writing this preface to Vol. III of "Canada
in Flanders" I am saying good-bye to my task as
author of the first two volumes.  The increasing
pressure of other duties has made it impossible for
me to pay those prolonged visits to the Front which
alone keep a writer in vivid touch with the
constantly developing realities of modern war, or to
spare the time for the proper study of the historical
material.  Under these circumstances it seemed
better to retain the Editorship of "Canada in
Flanders," but to hand over the story of the Somme
to the practised pen of Major Charles G. D. Roberts,
who was present with the Canadian Corps
during that Autumn Campaign.
</p>

<p>
But in doing this it is necessary to make good
as far as possible the errors and slips which have
come to light and been pointed out by the critics
in the text of Vol. II.
</p>

<p>
As in the case of Vol. I., the majority of the
mistakes is in the misspelling of names or the
confusion of identity between officers with the same
surname.  I particularly regret the mistake by which
the leadership of the advance on the lost craters at
St. Eloi on the night of April 6th is ascribed to
Lieutenant V. P. Murphy, of the 25th Battalion,
instead, as it ought to have been, to Lieutenant
G. D. Murphy, of the 28th Battalion (pp. 129, 132).
Similarly, on p. 42, the name of Sergeant-Major
Benton should have been inserted as the
sergeant-major who went out with Private Donoghue to the
rescue of the wounded; while the commanders of
the raiding party of the 19th (Ontario) Battalion
in August, 1916, should have been given as Captain
C. E. Kilmer and Lieutenant H. B. Pepler (p. 68).
</p>

<p>
In the description of the battle of Sanctuary
Wood there are several mistakes of the same
character.  Lieutenant Glassco, of the P.P.C.L.I.,
has his name misspelt on pp. 181 and 182, and
Captain A. G. Wilken, the heroic chaplain of the
1st C.M.R.'s, is reported as being killed, whereas
in reality he was taken prisoner.  On p. 216 it should
be made clear that the Colt guns under Lieutenant
Ziegler, which played so important a part in the
defence of the Hooge position on June 6th, belonged
to the Machine Gun Company of the 7th Brigade.
On p. 70 Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Hill, D.S.O.,
is wrongly given as the Colonel of the Royal
Canadian Regiment when the 3rd Division was
formed in January, 1916, instead of Lieutenant-Colonel
A. H. MacDonnell, D.S.O.; while the
Commander of the 5th C.F.A. Brigade at the same
period was Lieutenant-Colonel W. O. H. Dodds, and
not Lieutenant-Colonel E. A. Carruthers.
</p>

<p>
Among more general errors it may be noted that
Lieutenant Elliot is described on p. 104 as the
"signal" instead of the "signalling" officer, and
that the German unit opposed to us at St. Eloi was
the 214th Regiment, and not the 214th Battalion&mdash;a
German regiment consisting of three battalions
and approximating more in numbers to our brigade.
</p>

<p>
On more general questions, such as the position
and actions of units, only one controversy has been
raised, and that is concerned with the early stages
of the Battle of St. Eloi.  This difficulty is to some
extent inevitable, for with the exception of the
Second Battle of Ypres there has been no action in
this history of the Corps in which the true facts
have been more difficult to obtain than in that
confused fighting in the mud on the dreary dawn of
April 6th of 1916, which lost us the craters and the
advanced line.  But all the available evidence has
been sifted with the greatest care, and nothing has
been brought to my attention which makes me
inclined to modify or alter the provisional account
given in the second volume.  This does not mean
in the least that in the future quite fresh material,
both from Canadian and German sources, may not
become available after the war and throw a totally
new light on certain episodes.  With this additional
evidence before him the future historian may be
able to rewrite parts of the story from the
standpoint of this fuller knowledge.  There is, however,
one particular correction which can be made at once.
I find that I have done something less than justice
to the work of the 2nd Pioneer Battalion during
the St. Eloi fighting.  Their task here was one of
incredible difficulty owing to the conditions of
the weather, the state of the ground, to the severe
and continuous shelling to which the whole area
was subjected, and the uncertainty as to positions
which wrapped the whole action in a fog.  Yet the
Pioneers' work was carried through with great
courage and energy.  In particular, the reconstruction
of the old front British line from Shelley Farm
to No. 2 Crater, which is ascribed on p. 144 to the
infantry of the 5th Brigade, was in reality done by
the Pioneers, who also took a large share in placing
No. 2 Crater itself in an adequate state of defence.
</p>

<p>
There is an inevitable tendency to give to the
work of the troops immediately behind the firing-line
less attention and credit than they deserve.
</p>

<p>
The infantry sustain most of the hard knocks
when it comes to climbing the parapet, and in return
obtain the greater notice from the historian.  But
behind the thin and scattered lines, which wave
after wave fall or go plodding on, the gunners, the
sappers, and the pioneers are preparing or
consolidating the victory.  The battle is no longer
between the opposing lines of the infantry, for to
win a position you must hold it, and to hold it you
must have brought up swiftly and safely from the
rear bombs, ammunition, wire rations, and a means
of entry for the supporting and relieving troops,
the area of the battle is no longer the front line,
it is behind this that the enemy barrage descends,
and over a wide field of fire the German shells are
searching for all those who would bring up succour
and relief.  It is under these conditions that the
pioneers must do their work.  In the night, only
illumined by the fitful flare of the star-shells
shedding a pale and sudden luminance behind the
front line and leaving the darkness more intense
than ever, the old and battered communication
trench of the Germans has to be made good to the
front line.  The trench from previous occupation
is well known to the enemy, and as the pioneers
shovel out the mud and the dirt to the left and right
a new illumination is provided by the sudden glare
and suffocating fumes of the heavies bursting right
or left or in the trench itself.  But night at least
gives the appearance, if not the reality, of safety.
As the infantry go forward the work must often be
done in the broad daylight, the trench driven through
to the new line, or a new resistance built to face the
counter-attack.  The men of the Pioneers who have
to undertake this task must do it in cold blood.
They are robbed of that excitement of personal
conflict which can carry the fighting man through
the most desperate dangers in a frame of mind which
hardly remembers the horrors through which he
passes, and crowns the story of his achievements
with a halo and a fascination not granted to work
less interesting but no less vital.
</p>

<p>
The achievements of the 2nd Pioneer Battalion
at the Somme will take rank with any of those of
the infantry.  At Courcelette their duty was to
follow on the heels of the 2nd Division, to drive
communication trenches through without delay to
the new lines, and to relieve the infantry
immediately of the final consolidation of the captured
trenches.  In the darkness before the assault
Lieutenants McGhee and Davis crawled out into No
Man's Land and pegged out the line of trenches
to be dug next day.  The moment the 2nd Division
had taken the German front line the Pioneers
started out to drive these trenches through in broad
daylight and under a sweeping rain of heavies.
Lieutenant McGhee exhibited great courage and
devotion to duty; he was three times buried by the
explosion of heavy shells close to him, and three
times dug himself out with his entrenching tool and
continued to mark out the line of the advancing
trench for his men.  What the effect of such shelling
may be is illustrated by the extraordinary and
gruesome story of the death of Lieutenant Tracy of the
same regiment some days before.  While prospecting
in advance of the line a German shell burst right
on him.  A rescue party of Pioneers went out
immediately to find him on the spot of the shell-burst.
Not a sign of the unfortunate officer could be found,
and the search was abandoned.  On the day of
Courcelette his body was found by the advancing
infantry fifty yards from where he had been struck
down.  For the Pioneers this kind of work must
be done, day in and day out, or night in and night
out, for weeks at a time.  When the infantry is too
exhausted by its efforts to make good the line, the
Pioneers must be called up to supplement their
efforts.  If a strong point has to be built, it is to
the Pioneers that the engineer officer will look to
carry out his instructions, and in the achievement
of all these tasks the Pioneer Battalions of the
Canadians have covered themselves with glory.
</p>

<p>
It is now my duty to hand over to my successor.
Major Charles G. D. Roberts continues in
Vol. III. of Canada in France and Flanders, for France
has now given us the names of the Somme and of
Vimy, the story of the Autumn Campaign of 1916.  I
retire gladly in favour of one who has a real claim
to literary and historical fame.  The first and second
volumes were the hasty product of one who was an
amateur in the art of describing, but who, as an
amateur, did his best.  Major Roberts is a
professional in the sphere of letters and of history, and
therefore sets up a new and higher standard for the
volumes which are to follow.  In the sphere of
letters he is well known throughout the Empire for
his stories of the life of the men and the denizens
of the wild, through which there blows, like the
breeze shaking the pine-trees in the snows, both
the warm wind of romance and the cold breath of
reality.  His History of the Dominion is equally
familiar to all Canadians who care to
consult the past of their country.  In his record
of the great deeds of the Canadian Corps on
the Somme we shall find combined the two qualities
which make letters last, the imagination which can
convey to the future the agonies and heroisms of
the past, and the chiselled style shaping the rough
outlines of the records into a clean-cut and enduring
narrative.

CHAPTER I
</h3>

<h4>
THE FOURTH DIVISION
</h4>

<p>
In the first and second volumes of this history
Lord Beaverbrook has told the war-story of
Canada from the mobilisation of the 1st Canadian
Division at Valcartier in August, 1914, to the
conclusion of our work in the Ypres salient
in June, 1916.  He has dealt progressively with
from one to three divisions, bringing the second
and third in turn into his narrative, recording
the organisation of each as it came into being, and
then co-ordinating its military exploits with the
exploits of its sister divisions.
</p>

<p>
During all that time the 4th Canadian Division
was on its way.  It was struggling into existence.
Its battalions were forming, training, being reduced
to skeletons by the necessities of the veteran units
in France, and recovering strength by the
absorption of raw material.  The 44th Battalion was
mobilised in the winter of 1915, while the 1st
Division was still on Salisbury Plain; yet it was not
until the autumn of 1916 that it reached France
as a unit of the 4th Canadian Division.  Between
the date of its mobilisation and that of its first
contact with the enemy it supplied many drafts of
officers and men to reserve and fighting battalions
in England and France, and absorbed drafts of all
ranks from junior units.  It was so with all the
infantry battalions which, in time, went to the
composition of the new Division, only to a lesser degree
than in the case of the 44th.
</p>

<p>
Of the infantry brigades of this Division only the
10th is of purely Western origin, its battalions&mdash;the
44th, 46th, 47th, and 50th&mdash;having been
recruited in Winnipeg, Southern Saskatchewan,
British Columbia, and Calgary respectively.  These
battalions had comprised the 14th (Reserve)
Canadian Infantry Brigade during their period of
training in England previous to the formation of the
4th Division.  The brigade sailed for France on
August 10th, 1916, and took a place in the front
line for the first time twelve days later, when it
relieved our 4th Brigade in a section of our tortured
defences before Ypres.
</p>

<p>
During the first five months of its active service
the 10th was commanded by Brigadier-General
W. St. Pierre Hughes.  On January 18th, 1917, it was
taken over by Brigadier-General Edward Hilliam,
D.S.O., late C.O. of the 25th Battalion.  The story
of this Brigade's offensive and defensive operations
is to be found in subsequent chapters of this history
incorporated in the general narrative of Canadian
activities.
</p>

<p>
The 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade, organised
in May, 1916, lost two of its original battalions in
the following month, owing to the great and
immediate need of reinforcements at the front in
consequence of the bitter fighting of June in the Ypres
salient.  These units were replaced by others; and
when it commenced its actual war-service it
consisted of the 54th from Kootenay, the 75th from
Toronto, the 87th of Montreal, and the 102nd of
Northern British Columbia.  This Brigade was
originally commanded by Brigadier-General
F. O. W. Loomis, D.S.O., who had previously
commanded a battalion of the 1st Canadian
Division; but after Major-General Mercer was killed
in action in June, the 2nd Brigade contributed its
G.O.C., Major-General Lipsett, to the 3rd Division,
Loomis was recalled to France to take the 2nd
Brigade, and Lieutenant-Colonel V. W. Odlum,
D.S.O., of the 7th Battalion, was promoted to the
command of the 11th Brigade and the rank of
Brigadier-General.
</p>

<p>
The 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade was
organised from the 16th (Reserve) Brigade in May,
with Brigadier-General Lord Brooke in command.
It originally consisted of the 51st, 72nd, 73rd, and
87th Battalions, but in June twenty-four officers
and more than seven hundred other ranks of the
51st were drafted to France, and their place in the
Brigade was filled by the 78th.  The 87th was
transferred to the 11th Brigade.  The final composition
of the 12th Brigade was as follows:&mdash;38th Battalion
of Ottawa (its <i>personnel</i> representing such
well-known Canadian Militia regiments as the
Governor-General's Foot Guards, the Duke of Cornwall's
Own Rifles, the Brockville Rifles, the Lanark and
Renfrew Regiment and the Stormont and Glengarry
Highlanders), the 72nd Battalion of Vancouver, the
73rd of Montreal, and the 78th of Winnipeg.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after its arrival in France the command
of the 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade was
transferred to Brigadier-General J. H. MacBrien, D.S.O.
</p>

<p>
From the date of its organisation the 4th
Canadian Division has been commanded by
Major-General David Watson, C.B.
</p>

<p>
This Division has been fortunate from the first
in the matter of the <i>personnel</i> of its higher
commands and senior appointments.  Major-General
Watson commenced his military service in this war
in August, 1914, as a Lieutenant-Colonel.  He did
splendid work with his battalion&mdash;the 2nd (Central
Ontario)&mdash;during the Second Battle of Ypres and
until he was promoted to the command of the 5th
Brigade in the autumn of 1915.
</p>

<p>
Brigadier-General Edward Hilliam, who took
over the command of the 10th Brigade in January,
1917, has had a career of distinguished activity since
the first day of Canada's military participation in
the war.  As a Captain of the 5th Battalion he was
wounded at Gravenstafel Ridge on April 25th, 1915,
while engaged on a service of exceptional danger
and importance.  The story is told in Vol. I. of this
history.  After months more of hard service with
the 5th, and a step in rank, he was promoted
Lieutenant-Colonel and transferred to the 25th (Nova
Scotia) Battalion.  His success continued unfalteringly
with his new command, as the splendid work
of the Nova Scotians at Courcelette on September
15th, 1916, has proved to the world.
</p>

<p>
Brigadier-General Loomis, who commanded the
11th Brigade for a time in England, is another
survivor of the Second Battle of Ypres.  His original
battalion was the 13th Royal Highlanders of Canada.
From the 11th Brigade he was recalled to France
in June, 1916, to command the 2nd Brigade.  His
Brigade-Major, Captain Gardner, a veteran of the
7th Battalion, returned to France at the same time
and took over the 7th from Lieutenant-Colonel
Odlum, who was appointed to the command of the
11th Brigade.
</p>

<p>
Brigadier-General V. W. Odlum, D.S.O., before
his promotion to a brigade had commanded the 7th
(British Columbia) Battalion at the front since the
death of Lieutenant-Colonel Hart-McHarg in April,
1915.  To those who know, this statement sufficiently
explains Odlum's fitness for any fighting command.
</p>

<p>
Brigadier-General J. H. MacBrien, commanding
the 12th Brigade, was at one time D.A.A. and
O.M.G. of the 1st Canadian Division, and in
recognition of his services in this capacity he was
mentioned in despatches and made a Companion of the
Distinguished Service Order.  He was afterwards
promoted to the General Staff of the Canadian
Corps.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant-Colonel W. E. Ironsides, D.S.O.,
Major K. D. B. Murray, D.S.O., and Captain
A. A. Aitken, General Staff officers, first, second, and
third grade of the Division, all have served actively
on one or more of Britain's fighting fronts since the
first days of the war.  Captain R. M. Redmond was
drawn from the Casualty Centre after he had seen
service with the 60th Battalion of the 3rd Division.
All other officers of the Divisional Staff had seen
previous service in France, and a number of them
had been decorated for their good work.  By hard
work or hard fighting Lieutenant-Colonel E. B. Panet,
Colonel H. A. Chisholm, and Captain F. R. Burnside
had won the D.S.O., and Captain Meurling
and Hon. Major the Reverend A. M. Gordon the
Military Cross, long before the materialisation of
the 4th Canadian Division.
</p>

<p>
The 3rd Canadian Divisional Artillery, which was
organised and trained in England during the spring
and summer of 1916, and went to France with the
4th Division, consists of the 8th, 9th, 10th, and
11th Canadian Artillery Brigades and the Divisional
Artillery Ammunition Column.  The batteries and
sections of which this force was formed came
originally from almost every corner of Canada,
north and south, east and west.
</p>

<p>
For a time the Brigades were composed as
follows:&mdash;The 8th, of the 30th, 31st, 40th, and 41st
Field Batteries; the 9th, of the 32nd, 33rd, 45th,
and 46th Field Batteries; the 10th, of the 37th,
38th, 39th, and 44th Field Batteries; and the 11th
(Howitzer) Brigade of the 29th, 35th, 36th, and 43rd
Howitzer Batteries.  This organisation was not
satisfactory.  The 29th (Howitzer) Battery was left
with the 11th Brigade, and to it were added the
41st, 44th, and 46th Field Batteries.  To replace
these field batteries in the other Brigades the 35th
(Howitzer) Battery went to the 8th, the 36th to the
9th, and the 43rd to the 10th.  Thus each Brigade
was composed of three field batteries and one
howitzer battery.
</p>

<p>
The 8th Brigade, Canadian Field Artillery, which
was brought from Canada to England by
Lieutenant-Colonel Gillies, passed into the hands of
Lieutenant-Colonel D. T. V. Eaton, of the Royal
Canadian Horse Artillery, on March 9th, 1916.
Eaton had commanded the R.C.H.A. with our 1st
Division in France in 1915.  He is a professional
as well as a practical artillery officer, with years of
theoretical and scientific study behind his experience
in the field.
</p>

<p>
The command of the 9th Brigade, C.F.A., went
to Lieutenant-Colonel H. G. Carscallen, who had
long ago been mentioned in despatches for his work
at the Front with the 11th Battery; that of the 10th
to Lieutenant-Colonel G. H. Ralston, who distinguished
himself as far back as June, 1915, at the
"Duck's Bill," when two guns of his battery were
established and fought in our front-line trench,
seventy-five yards distant from the German trench,
with disastrous results to the enemy's wire, parapets,
and machine-gun emplacements (see Vol. I., p. 133).
Lieutenant-Colonel A. G. MacNaughton, late of the
2nd Brigade, C.F.A., was appointed to the 11th
Brigade.
</p>

<p>
These four Brigades and their ammunition
column went to France under the command of
Brigadier-General J. H. Mitchell, late of the 3rd
Brigade, C.F.A.  This officer had been mentioned
in despatches and awarded the Legion of Honour,
Croix d'Officier, a year before.
</p>

<p>
The 4th Canadian Division went to France in
August, 1916, the 10th Infantry Brigade arriving
on the 11th, the 11th Brigade on the 14th, and
the 12th Brigade on the 15th.  On the 17th they
assembled, and within the week were moved into
positions on the war-torn front of the Ypres salient.
There they remained until the first week in October,
when they joined the Canadian Corps on the Somme.
During their occupation of the Ypres salient each
of the three Brigades was withdrawn in turn for a
course of tactical training.
</p>

<p>
So it was that the autumn of 1916 saw the
Canadian Army in France flooding to and beyond the
one hundred thousand mark.  Four Divisions,
according to the old establishment, which gave
twenty-two thousand men of all ranks and arms to a
division, would account for eighty-eight thousand
Canadians in France at that time, but the development
of the machine-gun service and the creation of
trench-mortar batteries long ago caused the
outgrowth and consequent revision of that establishment.
And still, without the addition of a further
Division, the Canadian Army Corps continued to
grow, waxing greater daily to meet every progressive
need and condition of modern warfare.  By
January, 1917, Canada's man-power in France
reached the significant total of one hundred and
twelve thousand.  This figure takes no account of the
wastage of battle.  The seriously wounded and
work-worn who are returned to England are,
like the dead, immediately struck out of the tally.
This figure stands for fit Canadians actively
employed at the moment in first-hand combat with the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
In the past, great battles have been won and long
wars brought to a swift and violent end, tyrants have
been broken, races enslaved, and thrones overturned
by armies far weaker in numbers and in spirit
than these fighting legions of Canada.
</p>

<p>
To enforce the significance of this Canadian Field
Army of 112,000, we may compare the numbers
engaged in some of the decisive battles of the past.
The army of Napoleon, for instance, numbered
but 70,000 men when he broke the power of Austria
and Russia at Austerlitz.  Wellington won the
crushing victory of Vittoria, in the Peninsular War.
with a force of 65,000; and at Waterloo he
commanded rather less than 68,000.  The terrific
battle of Gettysburg, in the American Civil War,
was fought by 78,000 Federals against the slightly
smaller forces of the Southern Confederacy.  Even
at the great battle of Sedan, which decided the issue
of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the army of
France, on which all her hopes were staked&mdash;and
lost&mdash;numbered but 150,000.  From such figures
may be estimated the importance of Canada's contribution
in the present gigantic struggle for liberty
and right.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1914 Canada was a land of
peace, of self-interest, of political warfare, and
commercial and agricultural prosperity; and now her
thousands lie dead on foreign battlefields; thousands
of her sons have returned to her, maimed, broken,
and blind; her forward army fights on, continually
bleeding yet continually growing in strength,
reinforced from her trained troops in England; and
to her own home camps and garrisons her sons
continue to gather from counting-house, school, and
farm.

CHAPTER II
</h3>

<h4>
HOLDING THE LINE
</h4>

<p>
The Battle of Sanctuary Wood was fought and
endured throughout the first two days of June, 1916.
Canada's resistance to that terrific and overwhelming
onslaught of metal and men will live as long and
gloriously as any victory in the great story of our
arms.  During those two fateful days Canadian
trenches were obliterated&mdash;blown out of the ground;
dug-outs were buried and strong points crushed;
woods in our positions were mown and torn to earth;
Major-General Mercer was killed and one of our
Brigade commanders wounded and taken prisoner.
The Canadian front was crushed by that indescribable
deluge of exploding metal&mdash;but it was not broken.
</p>

<p>
Between the heroic actions in the Ypres salient
in June (1st to 15th) and the commencement of our
strenuous thrusts on the Somme front in
mid-September, no unit of the Canadian Corps was
in any major offensive operation.  But the
routine work of holding and strengthening our
positions continued with the full measure of that activity
for which the Canadians have become famous.
The vitality of our opposition to the confronting
masses of men and machinery did not lessen for an
instant.  Relieved from the recent terrific efforts of
defence and counter-attack, we were stationary yet
aggressive.  Hostile trenches and strongholds were
raided and bombarded, wire was cut by hand and
smashed by shell-fire, and mines were sprung.  All
arms continued to carry on enthusiastically, and the
mental peace and physical security of the occupants
of opposing positions were shattered constantly by
bayonet and grenade, trench-bomb, bullet, and shell.
The following instances will serve to illustrate the
nature of our activities throughout this period of
waiting, of preparation, and of so-called quiet.
</p>

<p>
Dominion Day (July 1st) was celebrated by the
26th (New Brunswick) Battalion in a manner little
appreciated by the grey ranks across the way.
Supported by the fire of our artillery and trench-mortars,
two officers and twenty-five other ranks operated
against a convenient point in the German front-line
trench.  The assaulting party were observed and
subjected to a brisk but inaccurate fire of
machine-guns and rifles before they had passed the enemy's
inner wire.  They pressed forward without a pause
and rushed the parapet.  The garrison of the trench
immediately retired from this threatened point
except for three men, who stuck to their loopholes
and continued firing.  Lieutenant Fleming accounted
for one of these by thrusting his revolver into a
loophole and returning the fire.  The trench was
then entered and its remaining defenders
disposed of.  After our party had investigated
about forty yards of the trench they were driven
out by a heavy bombardment of rifle-grenades and
mortar-bombs.  They then returned to our own lines
with a few slight casualties, some useful
information, and a quantity of German equipment.
</p>

<p>
An encounter in No Man's Land between a patrol
of the 22nd (French Canadian) Battalion and a
German patrol on the night of July 4th resulted in
the dispersion of the enemy and our capture of two
prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Ten nights later a reconnoitring patrol from the
25th (Nova Scotia) Battalion attacked an enemy
listening-post at the moment of its being strongly
reinforced.  After a brisk exchange of grenades the
Germans ran for their trench, leaving the field and
one of their wounded to us.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 25th a large German mine
was blown in our lines on the Bluff.  This was not
the enemy's first attempt to possess himself of that
advantageous position.  It will be remembered that
he attained his object in January of the same year
and was not driven out until a month later, and then
only at a heavy cost of killed and wounded.
Fortunately the second attempt to secure a foothold on
that ground failed utterly, thanks to the alertness
and prompt action of our troops immediately
concerned.  Briefly, the story of the foiled effort is
this:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The 1st Canadian Division, which had taken over
the Bluff sector on the 22nd of the month, received
warning two days later from Major North, of the
1st Canadian Tunnelling Company, that the enemy
might be depended upon to blow a mine very soon
somewhere in the vicinity.  The localities which
were considered with the liveliest suspicion were a
point known as the Bean and Trench 33.  The
Division immediately warned the 2nd Infantry
Brigade of the menace; the G.O.C. the Brigade
ordered reductions in the garrisons of the threatened
positions, the covering of that section of front by
machine-guns, and the detailing of parties for
counter-attack and of other parties for the vital work
of consolidation should a mine be blown.
</p>

<p>
The early hours of the night of the 25th were
unusually quiet about the Bluff.  Artillery was silent.
Snipers and machine-gunners seemed half-hearted
in their activities.  The 7th (British Columbia)
Battalion was engaged in preparing for a relief which
was to be completed by midnight.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock the quiet was shattered by a
tremendous convulsion.  Earth, fire, rock, and smoke
belched to heaven.  Trenches vanished, engulfed.
Instantly the S.O.S. rocket went up.  Our machine-guns
responded like crackling echoes of the
explosion.
</p>

<p>
Within thirty seconds of the rocket-signal for help
the guns of Dodd's Group commenced a crushing
bombardment of the German positions which
threatened the new crater.  Our counter-attacking
parties advanced, armed with rifles, grenades, and
machine-guns.  They occupied the forward lip of
the crater, the flanking shell-holes overlooking its
raw depths, certain points commanding the canal,
and a ridge running between an historic old crater
and the new.
</p>

<p>
The Germans, reinforced and ready for the dash
from cover and the occupation of the Crater
swarmed to their parapets, and swayed and seethed
there for a little while like a headed wave about to
break and flood forward.  Then the wave broke and
subsided&mdash;backward instead of forward.
</p>

<p>
The great attack was dead, dead in the first half-minute
of its furious and painful life, killed by the
smashing fire of our artillery and the whipping hail
of our machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
Within one and a half hours of the blowing of the
mine the O.C. the 7th Battalion reported to his
Brigadier that the menace was past, and that the
new crater was being swiftly absorbed by our
defensive positions.  Our artillery reduced its fire by
one-half.  Five minutes later the German artillery
retaliation ceased, the fire of our machine-guns and
artillery dropped to normal, and the relief of our
infantry&mdash;which had been interrupted and delayed
for nearly two hours&mdash;was calmly continued.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the precaution of thinning the garrisons
in the threatened locality, our casualties were
wonderfully light&mdash;less than fifty all told in killed,
wounded, and missing.  It is safe to say that the
enemy casualties, caused by our artillery, machine-guns,
Stokes and trench-mortar batteries, were much
heavier; and, in addition to their loss of life and
limb, the Germans lost their adventure.  The months
of toil devoted to the laying of the mine and the
tons of explosive which comprised it failed to
strengthen their position by a tittle or to weaken
ours by a jot.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 28th a patrol from the Nova
Scotian Battalion (25th), consisting of a lieutenant,
a sergeant, and four men, carried out a daring raid
on a small scale.  They bombed the German trench
at the point where they intended to enter, and were
about to negotiate the parapet when a party of eight
enemy bombers attacked them on the flank.  In the
brief but desperate fight which followed this
unexpected distraction three of the Canadians were
wounded and the eight Germans were disposed of.
Lieutenant Wise, with Sergeant Anderson and
Private Johnson, then entered the hostile trench and
discovered that their preliminary grenade-fire had
killed five of the garrison.  They drove the enemy
down the trench, until Anderson was wounded.
Lieutenant Wise ceased his offensive to help the
sergeant over the parapet, and while thus engaged
he received three wounds.  Johnson continued to
drive the enemy until all his grenades were thrown.
He then escaped from the trench, returned to our
lines, collected a rescue party, and led the way back
to the scene of action.  All our wounded were found
and brought in with the exception of Sergeant
Anderson.
</p>

<p>
At half-past eight on the morning of the 29th
the 19th (Ontario) Battalion made a daylight raid
into the enemy trenches on the St. Eloi front
between Ruined Farm and the Canal.  Two officers
and the scouts of the Battalion had devoted every
day and night of the preceding week to
reconnoitring the ground over which the attack was to be
made.  During the night of the 28th the enemy's
wire in front of the point selected for entry was
hand-cut by two men of the Battalion.  Machine-gun
fire on the hostile parapet at the threatened point
muffled the sound of the clipping of the wire.  The
raiding party, consisting of Captain C. L. Kilmer
Lieutenant H. B. Pepler, and eighteen N.C.O.'s and
men, covered three-quarters of their journey between
the lines by way of an old ditch, doubled across the
remaining forty-five yards, passed through the gaps
in the wire, and went over the parapet before they
were discovered by the enemy.  They moved to the
right and left along the trench, shooting and
bombing.  Upon the approach of strong German
reinforcements along a communication trench, the signal
to retire was given and successfully obeyed.  During
the evacuation of the trench the raiders suffered a
few slight casualties from grenade-fire, and the two
officers and a sergeant sustained shrapnel wounds.
Captain Kilmer was the last to leave the trench.
One of his ankles had been broken in the fight.  As
he was unable to reach our lines unassisted, and
unwilling to delay the retirement, he crawled into a
shell-hole situated about eight yards in front of the
German wire.  He was rescued from this insecure
retreat by Lieutenant Burnham, Corporal Wilson,
and Private Newton, who, covered by an accurate
barrage from the guns of Stewart's Group, moved
out to the shell-hole and back to our lines under a
heavy fire of machine-guns and rifles.
</p>

<p>
In this, the first of our daylight raids, no prisoners
were taken.  The action was too swift and the
encounters were too violent to permit of the removal
of a single living Hun; but the operation was highly
successful.  The occupants of the trench were
identified as the Royal Württembergers; valuable
information of a technical nature was obtained; two
machine-guns were put out of action and other
machine-gun and trench-mortar emplacements
located; many of the garrison of the trench were
shot, and four large dug-outs, crowded with men,
were effectively bombed; and it is reasonable to
suppose that the casualties inflicted by our artillery
were severe.  Lieutenant H. R. Dillon, Canadian
Field Artillery, who acted as Forward Observation
Officer throughout the operation, did splendid
service, especially during the rescue of Captain Kilmer,
when he stood fully exposed in No Man's Land at
a point within forty yards of the German trench, and
from there directed the fire of his battery.
Lieutenant Hooper, of the 19th Battalion, whose active
command during the raid included a Lewis gun,
snipers, and a telephonist, also did fine work.
</p>

<p>
On the night of August 5th-6th the 27th (City
of Winnipeg) Battalion sent a raiding party into the
enemy trenches opposite their front, with the usual
objects of obtaining prisoners and information and
inflicting casualties.  This raid was daringly
executed; but the fighting in the trench was so severe
that no prisoners were taken.  Lieutenant Harris
was wounded while carrying a wounded German
toward the point of entry.  Two unwounded
Germans were caught, but owing to their struggles and
the depth of the trench the efforts of their captors
to expel them over the parapet were ineffectual.
</p>

<p>
Eight nights later Lieutenant Clarkson of this
same Battalion led another party into the enemy's
lines and succeeded in bringing out a prisoner.  The
garrison of the invaded trench suffered heavily.  Of
Clarkson's party only one man was wounded.
</p>

<p>
A party from the 28th (North-West) Battalion,
supported by the artillery of Stuart's Group, our
trench-mortars, and Stokes guns, entered the
enemy's trenches in the neighbourhood of Ruined
Farm on the night of August 10th-11th.  Lieutenant
T. L. O. Williams, who commanded the
raiders, was wounded.  The enemy and his trenches
were severely knocked about and a prisoner was
brought back.
</p>

<p>
A dummy raid on the hostile positions at the
Hollandscheschuur Farm and Quarante Wood
salients was successfully practised by Dodd's
Group, C.F.A., and the 10th (Ontario) Battalion in
the early hours of August 15th.  The object of this
long-headed enterprise was to draw the Germans
in force into their front-line trenches and there drub
them thoroughly with the combined fire of our field
batteries, Stokes guns, and machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
At 3.45 a.m. three white flares were sent up from
our lines, and at the same time the enemy's
entanglements were violently shaken by means of strong
wires which connected them with our forward
positions.  The Germans immediately took alarm and
subjected their own entanglements to a heavy
grenade bombardment along the whole front from
the Quarante Wood to the Chemin de Poperinghe.
Our artillery and Stokes guns then opened heavily
and accurately on selected targets on the enemy
front and support trenches.  The Germans promptly
attempted a retaliation with the fire of a five-point-nine
battery; but as their first two shells fell in their
own lines at the Farm, the third in No Man's Land,
and the next thirty-seven on various points behind
and in their own defences, they soon became
discouraged.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the casualties and material damage
inflicted by our fire, the enemy must have suffered
heavily from the erratic performance of his own
five-point nines.
</p>

<p>
On the 17th a new strong point in the system of
enemy trenches known as "the Loop," in Sanctuary
Wood, about two thousand yards east of Zillebeke,
was subjected to a concentrated bombardment by
our 6-inch howitzers and partially destroyed.  To
complete its destruction the bombardment was
resumed during the night of the 17th and 18th, and
under cover of this bombardment a raid was
undertaken by a party from the Royal Canadian Regiment
against an advanced trench sector and bombing post
in the immediate neighbourhood of "the Loop."  The
idea was to take the enemy by surprise while
their attention was occupied by the bombardment,
and to capture prisoners.  In both these respects,
however, the operation was a failure, as the Germans
were found fully prepared and "standing to," with
the post heavily manned, and not only were no
prisoners taken, but not one of our men succeeded
in getting into the trench.  The affair was
memorable, however, for the amazing courage and audacity
with which it was pushed, in the teeth of overwhelming
and ready numbers, and for the resourcefulness
and heroic devotion with which the three
officers&mdash;Lieutenant Bole, leader of the raiding party, and
Lieutenants Churchill and Munn, who had come
to his assistance&mdash;succeeded in bringing all the
wounded back to our lines.  It was remarkable, too,
for the slaughter inflicted in the crowded trench by
this greatly daring handful of raiders.  The raiding
party consisted of sixteen N.C.O.'s and men under
Lieutenant Bole.  A gap was blown in the enemy
wire by the explosion of an ammonal tube.
Immediately Lieutenant Bole, who had gathered his men
at the head of the sap running outward from our
front line, led the way through the broken wire in
the hope of gaining the position in one rush.  They
were met, however, by a storm of bombs and
machine-gun fire, and fell rapidly.  But even the
wounded, if not utterly disabled, kept on hurling
their bombs.  Lance-Corporal Reynolds, though
already hit, succeeded in reaching the enemy's
parapet and delivering all his bombs with deadly
effect among the packed ranks.  Then, finding
himself alone, he withdrew, and dropped, with two more
wounds, a few yards back from the parapet.  By this
time every member of the party was down except
Lieutenant Bole, who occupied himself calmly with
the task of rescuing his wounded.  Lieutenant
Churchill came to his aid in this, while Lieutenant
Munn, taking his Lewis gun out into No Man's
Land, played it along the enemy's parapet to keep
down their fire.  Under cover of this gun, and of a
trench-mortar barrage which was presently dropped
along the trench, Lieutenant Bole got all his
wounded, one by one, back through the sap and
into our lines.  And so the affair ended&mdash;not,
indeed, with success, but with great distinction for all
concerned, and with the consolation of having
exacted a heavy toll in German lives.
</p>

<p>
It may be in place here to give an interesting
instance of the work that was being done by our
Tunnelling Companies&mdash;work calling for not only
great courage and devotion, but also the highest
technical skill and resource.  The work of a tunnelling
company at the Front is like a duel with knives
in a dark room, where one may feel at any moment
the stealthy adversary's knife in one's back.  The
tunnellers' ears, nerves, and intuition are ceaselessly
on the strain.  And just when he has successfully
mined his opponents and is about to blow them up,
he may be counter-mined himself and hurled into
eternity.  At the position known as "The Bluff,"
overlooking the Canal, a mine had been blown by
the enemy on July 25th, forming a new crater of
which we had at once taken possession.  By the
explosion a lip was formed on the east side of the
crater, which was capable of being transformed into
an extremely strong position.  But it was impossible
to work on this position with any degree of safety,
as it was certain that the enemy's gallery, from which
he had laid the mine, ran somewhere beneath the lip,
and was occupied.  Any work we should attempt on
the position would inevitably be heard in the gallery
and could be frustrated, disastrously for us, by the
explosion of another mine.  It was decided to try
to tunnel into the gallery from another direction.
Bore-holes, therefore, were driven in the supposed
direction of the gallery, in the hope of being able
to locate it exactly by listening.  In this the borers
were so successful that they came upon the gallery
before they expected to.  The enemy made them
aware of their success by exploding a charge beneath
the bore-holes, killing three of our men and injuring
others.  From this, however, it was obvious that the
main charge was not yet laid in the gallery.  Plans
were therefore made at once for endeavouring to
sap into the gallery from No Man's Land and blow
it in, so as to cut it off at some distance from the
crater, and thus, if possible, gain the crater end of
it for our own use.  In order to begin the work far
out in No Man's Land it was absolutely necessary
to obtain some cover there, and cover of such a
nature that the enemy should not recognise its
purpose.  The problem might well have seemed an
insurmountable one; but Major North, O.C. 1st
Tunnelling Company, Canadian Engineers, solved
it successfully, outwitting the Germans by an
ingenious ruse.  In the words of the Official
Report:&mdash;"One hundred pounds of ammonal were taken over
the parapet, and, after a rather difficult
reconnaissance, were placed about fifty feet in front of
the new crater....  This charge was wired back to
<i>Thames Street</i>.  In co-operation with the 5th
Battalion, two 60-pound trench-mortars were fired
at the German line in front at a prearranged time,
and at one minute interval.  A minute later our
charge was exploded, and after another minute
another trench-mortar was fired, the object being to
make the enemy believe that our charge was a
trench-mortar fallen short.  This charge made a crater
about 4 ft. deep and about 8 ft. in diameter,
breaking the tough surface layer of roots and gravel.  We
entered the crater immediately after it was blown,
placed another charge of 200 pounds of ammonal,
and blew it.  The next night we entered the crater,
finding it about 8 ft. deep and about 25 ft. in
diameter."  From this effective cover our boring
went on unsuspected, and a number of charges were
laid in different bore-holes close to where the gallery
was judged to run.  When these were simultaneously
exploded our calculations were proved correct.  A
sector of the gallery was found completely wrecked,
effectually cutting the communications, and we
entered into possession of the undamaged portion,
about 112 ft. in length, extending up into the new
crater.  We thus secured a valuable post of vantage
from which to conduct other mining operations, and
the crater was consolidated into a strong point of
considerable importance to our line.
</p>

<p>
By these and many similar small operations
the enemy were kept at a tension and subjected to
continual harassing annoyance; and our own men
were encouraged and stimulated while perfecting
themselves in the art of modern war.

CHAPTER III
</h3>

<h4>
ON THE SOMME
</h4>

<p>
It is around the part played by the Canadian
Forces in the gigantic and long-drawn-out struggle
known as "the Battle of the Somme" that the
interest of this third volume of our records must
centre.  The operations which began, on July 1st,
1916, with the ponderous thrusts of the British and
French Armies from before Albert and Bray, and
ended with the capture of Bapaume and Peronne on
March 17th and 18th, 1917, constituted, according to
the nomenclature of war before these days of
Armageddon, not one battle, indeed, but a campaign of
many great battles.  In this war, however, all is on a
scale so colossal that standards and terms of
comparison have to be enlarged in due proportion.  All
that unparalleled outpouring of agony and splendour,
of sacrifice and endurance, of heroism and
destruction, which the Germans have so poignantly&mdash;and
significantly&mdash;designated as "the blood-baths of
the Somme," may be taken as one battle, a battle
in whose vast rhythm the old values of hours and
days are supplanted by weeks and months.  Yet
never before in the world's history was there a
battle in which minutes have been held so priceless,
the seconds themselves so reckoned upon with
meticulous precision.  To present an adequate picture
of the battle as a whole, or even of the specific
part played in it by this or that particular corps, is
a task that will tax the powers of the inspired
historian, viewing the great subject at such a distance
that he can see it as a whole and in its true
perspective.  He will need to be a new Thucydides,
equipped, not only with grasp and vision, but also
with mastery of the magic of words.  And even so,
the story will never be half told.  Men will
continue digging into the records and unofficial accounts
as an inexhaustible mine, forever discovering new
jewels of wonder and terror and pity.  The utmost
that can be attempted in this unpretending narrative
is to set down the salient facts as to the achievements
of our own Divisions, with such detail as
can be sifted out, more or less at hazard, while the
dust of the stupendous conflict is still in the air.
</p>

<p>
On September 1st the Canadians began to move
from their sector of comparative calm toward the
vortex of the gigantic struggle, which was at this
period raging with special fury around Mouquet
Farm and over the blood-soaked undulations
between Pozières, Courcelette, and Martinpuich.
The quality of our troops, and the estimation in
which they were held by the Higher Command,
may be judged by the fact of their being allotted
to this vital area, which included the key positions
on the direct road to Bapaume.  How they justified
this confidence, and at what a cost, the sequel will
show.
</p>

<p>
The 1st Canadian Division, General Currie's
veterans of Ypres, was the first to move south, and
its headquarters were shifted to Rubempré, a few
kilometres due west from shell-torn Albert.  On
the 3rd we find certain battalions supporting the
Australians at Tom's Cut; and by the 4th the whole
division had moved up through Albert and out
along the Bapaume road into the stress of the
conflict, taking over from the 4th Australian Division
under heavy shell-fire, a hotly-contested line of
trenches running from a little behind Mouquet Farm
to the junction of Munster Alley with Cameron and
Highland trenches, about a mile to the south of
Courcelette.  On the following day the headquarters
of the Division were transferred from Rubempré to
the precarious shelters and dug-outs of Tara Mill,
on the Bapaume Road, near the grim collections of
calcined rubble which had been La Boiselle and
Ovillers.  On the 6th the 1st Canadian Divisional
Artillery arrived, and took over from the 2nd
Australian Divisional Artillery in support of General
Currie's line.  All the time, from the moment of
their arrival, our troops were kept under a very
destructive bombardment from 5.9, 8-inch, and
11-inch guns, the enemy hoping thus to shake their
morale before they could get settled into their new
positions; and the communication trenches were so
effectively blotted out that the front line could only
be reached by going overland.  The relief was no
more than satisfactorily completed when the
war-worn old Division was given a chance to show that
its mettle had not deteriorated in the transfer from
"the Salient" to the Somme.
</p>

<p>
In the early morning of the 8th an exposed section
of our front trench, about seventy-five yards in
extent, held by Lieutenant G. B. Murray, of the 14th
Battalion, with Lieutenant B. L. Cook and twenty-four
other ranks under his command, was attacked
with the bayonet by some two hundred of the enemy,
who succeeded at the first rush in forcing their way
into the position.  The little party of defenders,
however, held their ground with bomb, rifle, and
cold steel till reinforcements came up, whereupon
the assailants were expelled with heavy loss.  On
the following day came the opportunity which the
tried and seasoned Division was waiting for.  But
it came to one Battalion only&mdash;the "Fighting
Second" from Eastern Ontario, commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel A. E. Swift, D.S.O.
</p>

<p>
At exactly twenty-five minutes past one in the
afternoon of September 9th, the 2nd Battalion
relieved the 4th along the sector of trench, on the
right of the Canadian position, from which the attack
was to be made.  Some 250 yards to the front,
south-east of the Windmill on Bapaume Road and near
the northern extension of the trench called Walker
Avenue, was a blunt salient of German trench,
550 yards or so of it, which was strongly held and
proving a thorn in our side.  It hung doggedly and
defiantly athwart our plans for the advance on
Courcelette, a mile away to the north.  It was this
blunt salient that the "Fighting Second" had been
appointed to bite off in order to clear the way for
greater enterprises.  At a quarter to five precisely
the first wave of our attack went over the parapet
behind an intense barrage from all our guns.  The
first three companies of the Battalion only were
engaged in the attack, No. 4 Company being held
in reserve close by, in Luxton Trench and Walker
Avenue.  In spite of the punishment which the
Germans had been receiving from our barrage, the
assaulting wave encountered a sturdy resistance
when it reached its objective, and for a few minutes
the enemy trench was a pandemonium of savage
hand-to-hand struggles with bomb and bayonet.  It
was a reversion to the ancient form of individual
fighting, when great issues so often hung upon the
personal prowess of this or that one hero.  In this
mad encounter individual heroism was too universal
to admit of particularisation, but the exploit of
Corporal Clarke lifts itself into prominence even in that
splendid company.  Attacking with a squad of
bombers on the extreme left of the wave, he jumped
into the trench and found himself alone among a
swarm of extremely lively and unsubdued Germans.
With the remainder of his bombs he cleared a way
for himself.  Then with his revolver he accounted
for eighteen opponents, two of them being officers,
and found himself undisputed master of two bays
of the trench.  Even more splendid, perhaps, by
reason of its self-sacrificing devotion, was the action
of Lieutenant Pringle.  Leading his platoon against
the centre of the enemy's line, he caught sight of a
machine-gun hurriedly being mounted on the parapet
in such a position that it would be able to wipe out
his platoon.  Pushing forward at top speed through
the storm of shell and bullets, he threw himself
single-handed upon the gun-crew before they could
get their deadly weapon into action.  It never came
into action.  His men, following close behind, found
his body sprawled across the muzzle of the gun,
with the crew lying dead around him.  Along the
rest of the sector the fighting fervour of our men
was not to be denied, and the survivors of the enemy
presently flung up their hands.  In just twenty-two
minutes from the beginning of the assault the whole
objective was in our hands, 138 prisoners had been
gathered in, and the second, or consolidating, wave
of the attack was settling itself to the task of making
secure the captured position, reversing parapets and
firing-step, and commencing new communication
trenches back to the old line under the continuing
shelter of our barrage.  In the meantime, the assaulting
wave, taking their Lewis guns with them, moved
on and occupied a strong line of shell-holes in front
of the trench, while the bombing parties, in the face
of desperate opposition, fought their way along the
trench and established their blocks some sixty yards
to either flank.  The price of this victory was two
officers killed&mdash;Lieutenant Pringle and Lieutenant
Stuart&mdash;and nine wounded, the wounds of
three&mdash;Major Williams, Major A. E. McLaughlin, and
Lieutenant Bishop&mdash;later proving fatal; and of
other ranks 69 killed and 190 wounded.
</p>

<p>
In view of the narrow frontage involved in the
attack and the small number of troops engaged, this
operation must, of course, be classed as a minor
one.  But by reason of its soundness of conception,
the precision and completeness of its execution, and
the importance of its bearing upon our enterprise
against Courcelette a few days later, it takes rank
with affairs of much greater magnitude and renown.
It reflects unbounded credit upon the commanding
officer Colonel Swift, whose operation orders were
remarkable for their clarity, foresight, and exactness
of detail, and upon his second-in-command, Major
Vanderwater, who led the attack and carried out
those orders with such accuracy.  The Battalion was
congratulated by General Plunier, the Army
Commander, on the following day in terms of unusual
commendation.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian
Divisions, following hard upon the heels of the 1st,
had moved down from the north to Rubempré and
La Plouy, close behind the battle area.  On the
11th Major-General Turner, V.C., C.B., D.S.O.,
commanding the 2nd Division, transferred his
headquarters to Tara Hill, and assumed command of the
sector which had been so ably controlled by General
Currie since the 4th.  Throughout the nights of the
10th and 11th the 2nd Division was occupied in
relieving the 1st Division, the relief being carried
out under extremely trying conditions and at the
cost of a good many casualties; for not only the
line to be relieved, but all the stripped and tortured
waste behind it, was swept by an unceasing storm
from the German gun positions across the Ancre
and around Pys and Warlencourt.  Our communication
trenches in many places had been pounded out
of existence and landmarks obliterated, with the
consequence that some platoons went astray in the
darkness and the bewildering uproar, and were hours
late in reaching their allotted sectors of trench.
Moreover, along with their shrapnel and high
explosive, the enemy were sending over many gas and
tear shells, which added greatly to the strain of the
situation.  But the nerve of our Battalions refused
to be shaken by this stern ordeal.  There was no
going back, no wavering.  By the morning of the
12th the relief had been completed, and our lines
were held by fresh units keen for the test which was
already being prepared for them.
</p>

<p>
On this day the 1st Division went into rest camp
at Rubempré, and the 3rd Division, under
Major-General L. G. Lipsett, C.M.G., moved up to Usna
Hill, their arrival being greeted that same night by
a furious attack from the Germans at Mouquet
Farm.  The brunt of this attack was borne by the
2nd Battalion of the Canadian Mounted Rifles.
The assaulting waves were hurled back upon their
entrenchments after heavy punishment by our
machine-guns and Stokes trench-mortars.
</p>

<p>
And now we come to COURCELETTE&mdash;and write the
name in capital letters, as it is one of the shining
names in the story of Canadian valour.  The
storming of that heap of ruins which had once been a
sunny Picardian village nestling amid its orchards
was an achievement which must make its day&mdash;September
15th, 1916&mdash;for ever memorable in
Canadian history.  Of course, as the men who
fought and won at Courcelette would be the first
to protest, the action, splendid as it was, does not
stand in the same category with the Second Battle
of Ypres.  It is necessary, in writing of it, not to
let one's sense of proportion be obscured by its
brilliancy and completeness.  In the final analysis
it will show as a great operation perfectly planned,
and executed with a courage, swiftness, and
thoroughness calling for the highest praise.  Even
so, it constitutes but a single stride in the great
advance known as the Battle of the Somme.  Had
it failed, the result would not have been disaster
to the Somme operations as a whole, but merely a
costly, and perhaps depressing, postponement.  The
Second Battle of Ypres, on the other hand, belongs
not to Canada and the Empire alone, but to the
world.  It must rank among those few outstanding
achievements of uncalculated and self-sacrificing
heroism which serve as an incentive to noble spirits
for all time.  There was that of the miraculous about
it which startles and grips the imagination.  There
was that mingling of high tragedy and terror and
devotion which purges national pride to the purest
patriotism.  It tore victory&mdash;men hardly know how
to this day&mdash;from the jaws of overwhelming and
seemingly inevitable defeat; and had it failed, who
can set a limit to the catastrophe that might well
have followed?  Finally, at the Second Battle of
Ypres a young nation came suddenly to full manhood
through a well-nigh unparalleled initiation of
blood and splendour and tears.  It is right that the
name of YPRES should stand apart, and its
imperishable glory not be infringed upon when allotting
their meed of praise to other notable operations
of the Canadian Forces.
</p>

<p>
The capture of Courcelette was the pre-eminent
achievement of the Canadians during the year 1916.
The glory of it belongs to the 2nd Canadian Division,
which, under happy augury, fought the battle
on the anniversary of its arrival in France.  The
Division was highly trained and well seasoned to
war by a year of strenuous duty in the tormented
area of "the Salient."  It had learned all the
lessons of endurance and defence in the engulfing
mud of Flanders, in the holding of shattered
trenches against unrelenting shell-fire and obstinate
assault.  It had played its part with distinction in
the grim struggles around St. Eloi and Hooge.
When, therefore, it was selected by Sir Julian Byng
the G.O.C. the Canadian Corps, for the great thrust
against Courcelette, the General felt that he was
employing a weapon of tried keenness and temper
which could be depended upon neither to turn nor
to break in his hand.  The result, as will be seen,
more than amply justified his confidence.

Map&mdash;COURCELETTE Sept. 15th to Oct. 3rd (incl.) 1916
</p>

<p>
The capture of Courcelette, it must be borne in
mind, was not an isolated operation.  It was an
enterprise carried out by the Canadian Corps in
conjunction with an attack by our Fourth Army, and
by the French Army operating on our right, south
of the Somme.  The battle was fought in two distinct
actions, one in the early morning by the 4th and
6th Brigades, the other in the late afternoon and
evening by the 5th Brigade.  The first, properly
speaking, was the action planned for the day, its
objective being the capture of the formidable
defences known as Sugar Trench and the Sugar
Factory, which barred the way to Courcelette itself.
It was, indeed, an ample undertaking for one day;
but the success of the attack was so swift and
overwhelming, and our troops so straining on the leash,
that it was decided to thrust on again at once for
the greater prize without giving the dishevelled
adversary time to recover.  The second, and major,
portion of the operation, therefore, may be regarded
as an improvisation on the battlefield.  At 3.30 in
the afternoon the order came for the 5th Brigade,
which had been held in reserve during the morning
advance, to take Courcelette that same day.  Brief
as was the notice, within two hours the new operation
orders had been issued, and officers and N.C.O.'s
fully instructed as to their individual duties.  At
6.15 a.m. the barrage lifted and the attacking
battalions "went over."  Before 7.30 p.m. the whole of
Courcelette, with some 1,300 prisoners and much
booty, was in our hands, and the position was being
consolidated.  The second phase of the operation,
though planned out with such haste, had worked no
less smoothly and according to schedule than the
first, and had resulted in a success no less decisive.
All through the night, and for several days
thereafter, the Germans strove, by furious shelling and
desperate counter-attacks, to regain the stronghold
from which they had been so precipitately expelled.
But our troops proved no less dogged in holding on
than they had been dashing in attack, and all the
enemy's efforts to retrieve his loss resulted only in
further loss of ground and further punishment.
</p>

<p>
An added interest attaches to the action against
Courcelette from the fact that in this engagement
appeared for the first time those amazing engines
of war known as the "Tanks."  The cold official
designation of these monsters is simply "Heavy
Machine-Gun Battery."  But Tommy Atkins, with
his fine sense of the fitness of things and his gift for
apt nomenclature, could not possibly leave this most
daringly original offspring of our military inventiveness
to labour under so commonplace a designation.
He took this uncouth but invincible ally to his heart
at once, and in humorous appreciation christened it
a "Tank."  And a Tank the amazing creation will
remain, except for the purpose of some formal official
documents.  How effectively the Tanks played their
novel <i>rôle</i> in the fight for Courcelette will appear
in succeeding chapters in course of the detailed
account of the individual units involved.  Suffice
it to say here that the high opinion formed on this,
their first appearance, as to the fighting value of this
new engine of attack has been more than justified
by its later performances, which have confounded
the jeers of the pessimist and the sceptic.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<h4>
THE SUGAR FACTORY AND COURCELETTE
</h4>

<p>
When the Canadians came up to join the struggle
on the Somme, they arrived under happy auspices.
There was a sense of victory in the air.  This is not
less true literally than as a figure of speech; for on
every hand the clear sky of early autumn in Picardy
was dotted by our stationary observation balloons,
and threaded by our darting 'planes, which scouted
confidently far over the enemy lines or methodically
registered for the massed ranks of our guns.  Just
at this period the supremacy of our Air Service was
hardly ever disputed.  The German 'planes rarely
explored beyond our lines, and the German
"sausages" seldom ventured aloft, having learned
that such a venture was equivalent to speedy
suicide.  Moreover, here on the Somme Front our
Battalions realised at once that, upon whatsoever
hard undertaking they might be launched, they
would have the support of an overmastering weight
of artillery.  Shell-fire, however murderous, loses
half its effect upon the men's spirit when they feel
that what they are enduring is mild compared to the
avalanche of destruction which their own batteries,
close behind them, are at the same moment letting
loose upon the enemy.  Altogether it was a tonic
change for our Battalions, after their long gruelling
in "the Salient," where at times they had felt
themselves in much the position of the toad under the
harrow, ground down into the Flanders mire by
bombardments from three sides at once, and ceaselessly
overlooked by an adversary holding superior
positions.  Here at last they marched up into the
fight over ground wrenched from the enemy in spite
of his most deliberate and desperate efforts to hold
on to it.  Here they felt that they would have a
chance to "get a bit of their own back"&mdash;and, as the
event will show, they got it, full measure and
running over.
</p>

<p>
The terrain over which the attack was to be made
is a gently undulating expanse of farm lands
stripped naked by the incessant storm of shell-fire
and closely pitted with shell-holes and craters.  Of
grass or herbage not a blade remained, of trees but
here and there a bald and riven stump.  Dividing
this unspeakable waste runs the straight highway
from Albert to Bapaume, thick strung with ruined,
or rather obliterated, villages.  Of these the most
advanced in our possession was Pozières, with the
great road running directly through it.  A mile and
a half further on the road runs midway between
the twin villages of Courcelette (on the left) and
Martinpuich (on the right), which lie about
three-quarters of a mile apart.  A little nearer our line,
and flush with the left of the road&mdash;just about a
mile from the eastern limit of Pozières&mdash;stood a
mass of partly demolished brick buildings which
had been a great sugar factory, and now, heavily
entrenched and fortified by all the arts of the
German engineers, constituted the most formidable
outpost of Courcelette as well as an important flank
defence to the position of Martinpuich.  From the
western extremity of Martinpuich a strong trench
known as Candy Trench ran north-west to the
Bapaume Road, skirted the west side of the Sugar
Factory, continued in the same direction for a
couple of hundred yards past that stronghold, and
joined, at right angles, another deeply entrenched
and strongly held line called Sugar Trench, which
ran south-west for a distance of about twelve
hundred yards and ended at McDonnell Road, a
second-class thoroughfare almost parallel to the
Bapaume highway.  It was these two great
trenches, each nearly three-quarters of a mile in
length, forming two sides of a triangle with the
Sugar Factory Fort in the apex, which constituted
the grand obstacle to any advance on Courcelette
itself.  It was an obstacle of the first order, lavishly
supported by bombing and machine-gun posts, its
flanks fully guarded by trench-works outside of
Martinpuich and along McDonnell Road.  Such
and so formidable was the objective which the 2nd
Division set itself out to gain on that memorable
morning of the 15th.
</p>

<p>
The troops detailed for the attack were the 4th
and 6th Brigades, the 5th being held in reserve.
The position from which the attack was ordered to
start was a line of trench covering the front of
Pozières, and something under half a mile in
advance of the edge of the village.  This line,
roughly speaking about a mile in extent, ran
south-west and north-west across the Bapaume Road,
which divided it at right angles into two almost
equal sectors, the major sector being that to the
north or left of the road.  The extreme left of the
line rested on McDonnell Road, and joined up at
that point with the 3rd Canadian Division.  The
right connected with the 15th British Division,
which lay facing Martinpuich and kept the enemy
force there fully occupied.  The sector to the right
of the Bapaume Road was in the hands of the 4th
Brigade, under Brigadier-General R. Rennie,
M.V.O., D.S.O., while the left sector was allotted
to the 6th, under Brigadier-General H. D. B. Ketchen,
C.M.G.  The attacking line of the 4th
Brigade was made up as follows:&mdash;On the right
the 18th Battalion (Western Ontario), commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Milligan; centre, the 20th
Battalion (Northern and Central Ontario),
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Rogers; and
on the left the 21st Battalion (Eastern Ontario),
under Lieutenant-Colonel Elmer Jones.  In Brigade
Reserve was the 24th Battalion (Victoria Rifles of
Canada), under Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Gunn.
The attacking line of the 6th Brigade consisted of
the 27th Battalion (City of Winnipeg), commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel P. J. Daly, D.S.O.; the
28th (North-West), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
J. F. Embury, C.M.G.; and the 31st
(Alberta), under Lieutenant-Colonel A. H. Bell,
with the 29th (Vancouver), familiarly known as
Tobin's Tigers, under Lieutenant-Colonel
J. S. Tait, in Brigade Reserve.  The field guns covering
the attack consisted of the 1st Brigade of the 1st
Canadian Divisional Artillery and four Brigades
of the 18th Divisional Artillery, under Brigadier-General
Metcalfe, D.S.O., on the right, and on the
left three Brigades of the 1st Canadian Divisional
Artillery and one Brigade of the Lahore Artillery,
under the command of Brigadier-General Thacker.
The barrage work of both these groups throughout
the attack was of a closeness and accuracy which
left nothing to be desired.  It covered both the
advance and the consolidation so effectually that our
casualty list, though serious, was much smaller than
the difficulties of the operation and the strength of
the forces opposed to us had permitted us to hope.
</p>

<p>
The artillery preparation for the attack was
begun, by the heavy guns and howitzers, at 1 o'clock
in the afternoon of September 14th.  From that hour
until 3 o'clock in the morning of the 15th the enemy's
position was subjected to a deluge of high explosive.
At 3 o'clock this fire diminished in intensity.
At 4 o'clock it ceased abruptly.  A sudden calm fell
upon the opposing lines&mdash;a calm as full of menace
in its sinister suggestiveness, like the core of silence
at the heart of the cyclone, as the devouring roar
of the bombardment.  At the highest pitch of
expectation our Battalions waited for the fateful hour
of "zero time" creeping up with the dawn.
</p>

<p>
During this slow hour of waiting, always so stern
a test to the nerve of the most seasoned troops,
"occurred an incident which"&mdash;to quote from Major
F. Davy's spirited and picturesque account of the
battle&mdash;"had it not been promptly met by the
vigour and resolution of the Canadians, might have
marred, perhaps prevented, the whole attack.  A
determined attack by a strong enemy bombing party
was made upon the right sector of the 4th Brigade
front.  A portion of the attacking party had actually
reached our trenches at the time the attack started.
It was overcome by vigorous bombing and rifle fire.
A bombing officer in the disputed section, Lieutenant
Hugh H. Sykes, 18th Battalion, promptly organised
his defence and effectually maintained his position.
Lieutenant Gidley, of the 19th Battalion, and parties
of bombers from that unit and the 20th Battalion
also took part, and frustrated what might have
developed into a formidable attack had the initial
attempt been successful.  The enemy's preparations
for this attack eventually told against him, for the
strong force he placed in his front trenches to exploit
any initial success suffered heavily as our barrage
came down upon it."
</p>

<p>
At dawn of the 15th the air was dry, crisp, and
clear&mdash;the bite of autumn in it.  Patches of pale
sky glimmered abundantly between driven fleeces of
cloud with promise of fine fighting weather&mdash;high
visibility, and no baffling obstruction to the work of
our airmen.  The ground, tossed and furrowed
though it was in every direction by the demoniacal
ploughshares of the high explosive, gave firm
footing&mdash;for the curse of the Somme mud had not yet
fallen upon our operations.  It was such an autumn
morning indeed, as to turn men's hearts, with a
homesick pang, to the remembrance that this was
the date when the hunting season would open in far
Canadian woods and swales and coverts.  But it was
other hunting that opened this day for Canadians
on the Bapaume Road&mdash;the hunting of the
dragon-spawn of treachery and rape.
</p>

<p>
"Zero hour" had been set for 6.20.  At last it
came.  On the minute&mdash;nay, on the second, so exact
is now the synchronising of all watches for this
work&mdash;with a wide-flung, sky-splitting roar our barrage-fire
opened.  At the same instant all along our front
appeared the round, basin-like helmets of the men
of our first wave as they climbed over the parapets
of the "jumping-off" trenches.  Their appearance
in itself marked an appreciable gain of ground
already secured, for these jumping-off trenches had
been dug, with infinite toil and secrecy and at heavy
risk, at a distance of 100 to 150 yards in advance of
our established front-line trench, by so much
shortening the perilous path across the open to our
objectives.  This arduous and valuable work had
been carried out by the 19th Battalion (Toronto and
Hamilton) on the right, and by the 29th (Vancouver)
on the left.
</p>

<p>
At four minutes past zero time the barrage lifted
to a line about 100 yards farther on, and in another
minute our first waves (the attack was ordered in
four waves) was in possession of the first of the
German trenches.  This trench, which ran (as will
be seen by the map) close along our whole attacking
front, was not very strongly held, and the resistance
offered by its defenders was no more than enough
to warm our men up for what was to follow.
</p>

<p>
From this point it is necessary to trace the
progress of the battle Brigade by Brigade rather than
as a whole, for the problems confronting the 4th
Brigade, on the right (as will be seen from the map),
were different from those which the 6th Brigade, on
the left, had to deal with.  Suffice it to say here,
by way of clamping the two sections of the movement
together, that by 8 o'clock both Brigades were
receiving the congratulations of the Divisional
Commander, General Turner, upon their swift success.
By 8.30 the last of our objectives was completely in
our hands and being consolidated, while the enemy,
dazed by the swiftness of their overthrow and
demoralised to the point of panic by the implacable
onslaught of the Tanks, had fled behind the inner
defences of Courcelette.  The way into the
stronghold lay wide open.
</p>

<p>
The waves of an attack, under the latest conditions
of warfare, go forward not in one long sweep,
but in a succession of short advances strictly
regulated by the successive steps of the barrage fire.
Each time the barrage lifts forward&mdash;which it does
according to a scheme previously worked out to the
minute and the yard&mdash;the attacking lines must
instantly move up behind it, as close as possible to
the shelter of the appalling curtain of flame and
death which it lets down before them.  The progress
of the wave being thus so strictly scheduled, it must
often leave small enemy posts in its rear, or
dug-outs sheltering furtive bands of machine-gunners.
To deal with these "remainders"&mdash;which might
easily become a serious menace, or even bring about
complete disaster&mdash;behind the waves come the
"mopping-up" parties, whose job it is to ferret out
the hidden posts, clear the dug-outs, and gather in
prisoners.  The advance of the 4th Brigade on all
its fronts, and in spite of desperate opposition, was
so rapid and irresistible that it left behind plenty
of work for its mopping-up parties.
</p>

<p>
Within fifteen minutes of going over the Brigade
was in possession of another line of German trench,
from three to four hundred yards behind the first
line, running south-east from the Bapaume Road
towards the Martinpuich Road.  In the deep bays
of this trench the contention was bitter and severe,
and here occurred one of those instances of treachery
for which the German has shown such peculiar
aptitude.  A party of the enemy threw up their
hands, with, the customary cry of "Kamerad!
Kamerad!" and surrendered to a company of the
18th Battalion, under the command of Captain
S. Loghrin.  As Captain Loghrin was accepting their
surrender one of the party threw a bomb at him
and blew him to pieces.  The Captain's followers
flung themselves forward in a fury, and not one
German in that sector of the trench escaped the
steel.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the advance the three assaulting
Battalions of the Brigade, in spite of varying
obstacles, succeeded in maintaining an even
frontage.  When the 18th, on the right, and the
20th, in the centre, fighting their way forward
through the storm of shell and shrapnel and the
deadly sleet of the machine-guns, had reached and
taken Candy Trench, the final objective set them,
it was still scarcely more than 7 o'clock.  Three or
four minutes in advance of them the 21st Battalion
on the left, had reached the Sugar Factory and
gained a footing there.
</p>

<p>
The Factory, though a redoubtable stronghold,
had already been badly knocked about by our big
guns.  Now, within a very few minutes, it was
surrounded on three sides by our exultant troops, who
were not to be denied.  After a mad half-hour of
hand-to-hand struggle in a hell of grenade and
machine-gun fire, from the dreadful turmoil of
grunting, cursing, and shouting, the blood and the
sweat of savage bodily combat, victory suddenly
emerged, and the heap of ruins remained securely
in our hands&mdash;along with 125 prisoners, of whom
10 were officers. One of the companies which
distinguished themselves in this Homeric bout&mdash;"B"
Company of the 21st Battalion&mdash;was commanded
and most efficiently handled throughout the crisis
of the affair by its senior non-commissioned officer,
Sergeant-Major Dear, every one of its officers
having fallen during its hard-fought advance along
the Bapaume Road.
</p>

<p>
The unexpectedly swift collapse of this
stronghold of the Sugar Factory&mdash;which the enemy had
thought to make impregnable&mdash;was hastened, no
doubt, by the intervention of one of the "Tanks."  This
monster, apparently eyeless, its carapace a
daub of uncouth colours, squat and portentous as
one of those colossal saurians which we picture
emerging from the Eocene slime, had wallowed its
slow, irresistible way up over the trenches and
shell-holes, belching fire from its sides and its dreadful,
blind, blunt snout. Bullets and shrapnel fell
harmlessly as snowflakes upon its impervious shell.
Bombs exploded thickly upon it, and, though
wrapping it in flame, did no more than deface the
fantastic patterns of its paint. Its path, wherever it
moved, was spread with panic. In the teeth of the
most concentrated fire it waddled deliberately up to
the barriers of the Sugar Factory, trod them down
without haste or effort, and exterminated a
defending machine-gun with its crew. Then, crashing
ponderously through or over every kind of obstacle,
made a slow circuit of the Factory, halting
stolidly here and there to blot out a troublesome
nest of machine-gunners or to preside over the
submission of a bunch of horror-stricken Huns. Its
work done at this point, it lumbered off to seek
adventure elsewhere, its grotesque&mdash;and, unfortunately,
vulnerable&mdash;little tail bobbing absurdly
over the shell-holes.
</p>

<p>
The 4th Brigade, having gained all its objectives,
was now in no mood to rest content.  The task of
consolidation being well in hand, the 20th Battalion,
in the centre of the line, sent forward a patrol under
Captain Heron, M.C., the Battalion scouting officer.
With great audacity and skill, Captain Heron
worked his way along parallel to the Bapaume
Road for a distance of 800 yards, and broke into
the trench known as Gun Pit Trench.  This was an
important work, protecting, and in part coinciding
with, the sunken road which forms the link between
Courcelette and Martinpuich.  Greatly daring&mdash;and
profiting, no doubt, by the demoralising effect of the
Tank's peregrinations in the neighbourhood&mdash;the
little party bombed several dug-outs, and returned
with two captured machine-guns and two prisoners
to show for their splendidly insolent exploit.  They
reported the trench lightly held, whereupon the
Brigade, promptly grasping the occasion, swept
forward in a new&mdash;and thoroughly impromptu
attack.  Before 10 o'clock the trench was in our
hands, with 50 prisoners (including two officers), a
machine-gun, and three trench-mortars.  Still
unwearied, still unsated with success, the exultant
Battalions pushed on and gained a line along the
eastern side of the sunken road, where by 1 o'clock
they had securely dug themselves in.  This handsome
and unpremeditated gain greatly simplified
the consolidating of our position at Candy Trench
and the Sugar Factory, and immediately made practicable
the main operation against Courcelette itself.
</p>

<p>
With no less brilliancy and determination, meanwhile,
the 6th Brigade, on the left, had been carrying
out its share of the enterprise.  From the first of
the attack, or at least from its first objective
(the first German trench) onward, it encountered a
more stubborn resistance than that with which the
4th had to contend.  Diagonally across the path of
their advance, from the point on the right where the
first German trench joined the Bapaume Road
northwards to a juncture with McDonnell Road on
the westernmost edge of Courcelette, ran a sunken
road which had been strengthened by deep
entrenching.  It is shown on the map as Taffy
Trench&mdash;and was so named by the troops doubtless in
recognition of its complete harmony with the
system of Sugar Trench, Candy Trench, and the
Sugar Factory fitly presiding over all.  Furthermore,
the Brigade's advance was flanked throughout
by strong enemy posts strung along McDonnell
Road.  The Battalion on the left (the 31st of
Alberta) had not only to reduce these as it
went, and to accomplish the reduction rapidly so
as not to delay the main advance, but it had also to
establish a defensive flank at the same time and
thoroughly secure it in order to cover the advance
against an enfilading assault from the network of
German trenches spreading towards the north and
north-west.
</p>

<p>
The attacking line of the 6th Brigade was
somewhat differently organised from that of the 4th.
Instead of being divided into three sectors, one for
each of the three Battalions involved, it was divided
into two sectors only.  The 27th Battalion formed
the attacking waves on the right half of the line,
the 28th took the left half, while the 31st supplied
the "mopping-up" parties to both sectors.  The
frontage allotted to the Brigade was about 1,800
yards, and the extreme depth of its attack, from the
jumping-off trenches to the farthest objective, was
something over a mile.
</p>

<p>
As with the 4th Brigade, the first objective (the
original German front line) was carried swiftly and
with little difficulty, and the whole line swept
forward behind our barrage as coolly and according to
book as if on the parade-ground.  The German fire,
both artillery and machine-gun, was fierce and
effective, but as our bayonets came through it the
enemy, as a rule, either fled, or threw up their hands,
or scurried like rabbits into the dug-outs, refusing
to face the cold steel.  But on the left the wave of
the 28th Battalion presently encountered a rock of
sterner substance in the form of a machine-gun
stronghold which had survived unscathed both our
preliminary bombardment and our barrage.  The
little garrison here fought stubbornly in the effort to
stay our onrush.  The heart of their defence was
an officer who both fought and directed magnificently
and inspired his followers with his own
courage.  Our line was in some danger of being
dislocated.  As Canadian river-men would say, it
had run up against a "snag" at this point.  But
one of our officers, Captain Bredin, of the 28th.
perceiving a worthy foeman, ran out of the line
and around the flank, and engaged him with a
revolver.  The German fell, and with his fall the spirit
went out of his followers.  The post was carried
almost at once.  Among the prisoners taken was a
machine-gunner who was chained to his gun.  It
was a strange enough sight to our men, this highly-trained
soldier fettered to his duty like a criminal,
a steel stake driven into the ground on either side
of him, one chain around his waist and another
locked to an iron ring on his leg.  The psychology
of a race which discerns in such treatment an incentive
to heroic endeavour is not unlikely to elude our
apprehension.
</p>

<p>
By this time the German guns had realised the
formidable nature of our advance and the depth of
our penetration into the outer defences of
Courcelette.  The storm of shell and shrapnel that swept
our line suddenly redoubled its fury.  But our men
went straight on through it, ignoring their casualties.
The deadly diagonal of the sunken road was crowded
with German troops, but our men flung themselves
into it with the bayonet, and left it packed with
German dead.
</p>

<p>
The course of this savage hand-to-hand struggle
was thronged with incidents of individual heroism,
so numerous as to make even a partial chronicling
of them impossible in these pages.  A couple of
instances, however, may be cited as showing that
the huge development of the mechanical element in
modern warfare has not robbed the personal element
of its opportunity or of its decisive influence.  The
case of Private Stevens, of the 28th Battalion, is
one in point.  His story may be quoted as follows
from the Brigade Report:&mdash;"Just prior to the
assault a party of six snipers from the 28th Battalion
was posted in the shallow jumping-off trench to
keep busy an enemy detachment of about 20 men
which had been troubling our lines.  All the members
of this small party, except Private Stevens, were
either killed or wounded, and Stevens himself had
two holes through his steel helmet, a deep wound in
his left shoulder, and a gash in his forehead.
Nothing daunted, he kept on sniping and killed
several of the enemy.  His rifle was smashed by a
shell just as the assault went forward.  He
picked up a rifle with fixed bayonet, and,
dashing forward with the assault, entered an
enemy's strong point, and single-handed captured
five Boches and brought them back to our lines."  The
exploit of Lieutenant Clarkson, of the 27th
Battalion, is, in another fashion, equally significant
by reason of the unquenchable dominance of spirit
which it displays.  To quote again from the same
Report:&mdash;"Lieutenant Clarkson was severely
wounded in the knee, at the sunken road, and just
as he fell four Germans came out of a deep
dug-out.  He at once covered them with his revolver,
and, ordering them to improvise a stretcher out of a
couple of rifles, made them carry him to our lines,
and there handed them over prisoners.  On the way
in, as soon as his bearers showed the least sign of
any opposition to his wishes, he quelled it with his
revolver."
</p>

<p>
By a quarter to eight, in spite of all opposition
and an unexpected addition to its task, the Brigade
had gained its final objective and set itself strenuously
to the work of consolidation, anticipating energetic
counter-attacks.  The addition referred to was an
enforced extension to the left of about three hundred
and fifty yards, which was found necessary in order
to secure the flank.  This operation, which was
stubbornly resisted by strong German detachments in
the Courcelette Road, was carried out with a rush by
the 28th Battalion.  Immediately the new line was
secured three patrols were sent out beyond the line
by the 31st Battalion.  These patrols succeeded in
establishing themselves, for purposes of observation,
close to the southern edge of the village, and
several of their scouts made their way into the
village itself.  The reports which they brought back
were so sanguine that the Brigade, its blood being
up, begged permission to pursue its success by
an immediate assault upon the village.  This
proposal, however, was promptly vetoed, the Higher
Command having already in view the plans for the
afternoon.  The impetuous 6th was obliged,
therefore, to content itself with its very handsome
achievement, which was not only so brilliant in
itself as to deserve far more attention than it has
received, but was also of vital importance to the
unfolding of our final operations against Courcelette.
The great advance of the 5th Brigade in the
afternoon, with its swift success in bringing the
whole village permanently within our lines, was a
more outstanding exploit by reason of the
conspicuousness of the goal gained thereby.  But it
must not be forgotten that Courcelette was fully
half-won by the victories of the 4th and 6th Brigades in
the early morning.  The honours of the 2nd Division
are fairly shared among all three Brigades.  It was
wholly because the morning triumph of the 4th and
6th Brigades went well beyond the utmost that had
been expected of it that the afternoon attack was
undertaken&mdash;and that September 15th became, in
the Canadian War Calendar, COURCELETTE DAY.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<h4>
COURCELETTE (<i>continued</i>).
</h4>

<p>
The afternoon battle, which gave Courcelette
solidly into our hands, was, as we have seen, the
affair of the 5th Brigade, under Brigadier-General
A. H. McDonnell, C.M.G., D.S.O.  All the morning,
fired by the successes of the 4th and 6th, the Brigade,
held in reserve, had been fretting on the curb.  As
the G.O.C., with his Battalion Commanders, watched
the fierce fighting and exultant progress of the other
two Brigades, they began to wonder uneasily if the
<i>rôle</i> of spectator was the only one that would fall
to them in this great adventure.  All doubts,
however, were presently removed.  At 3.30 came orders
for the Brigade to take the village of Courcelette
that same afternoon.
</p>

<p>
It was what in commercial terms would be called
a "rush order," but the Brigade, already strung up
to the highest pitch of expectancy, had no hesitation
in undertaking to fill it.  Operation orders were
drawn up in haste; but that there was no sacrifice
of explicitness and detail, on account of this haste,
was proved by the accuracy and smoothness with
which they worked out in the application.  Officers
and N.C.O.'s had to be instructed in their parts,
yet all was so expeditiously managed that by
5 o'clock the advance, starting from its rendezvous
point, was working its way up across the open under
heavy shell-fire to the positions captured in the
morning.  It was from these new positions that the
assault was to begin.
</p>

<p>
The three Battalions which made the attack&mdash;the
three which actually carried out the storming of
Courcelette&mdash;were the 22nd (French-Canadians, of
Montreal), the 25th (Nova Scotia), and the 26th
(New Brunswick).  The 24th Battalion (Victoria
Rifles of Canada) was held in reserve.  The right
of the attacking line was allotted to the
French-Canadians, whose objective was the whole of the
village to the right of the main street, running north.
The left of the line was taken by the Nova Scotians,
whose task was to storm the left half of the village.
The steeple of the village church formed the
landmark dividing the two objectives.  The New
Brunswickers followed close behind to support the assault,
to deal with strong points which had proved too
obdurate for the attacking waves, and thoroughly to
mop up the whole village.
</p>

<p>
The action being a direct frontal attack, with
no feints or flank diversions, and carried to its
triumphant conclusion along its whole front, on
schedule time and in precise accord with orders, the
story of it does not afford that intense dramatic
interest, those soul-racking fluctuations, those
moments of terrible suspense, those snatchings of
victory out of defeat, which may be found in the
accounts of many lesser engagements.  There were
practically no fluctuations; and there was never, in
the assailing waves, a moment of doubt as to the
result.  From flank to flank the advance was so
irresistible, so implacable and undeviating, that within
one hour and a quarter from the first lift of our
barrage, the report went back to Headquarters that
Courcelette was completely in our hands and that
the work of consolidation was under way.  Considering
the distance and nature of the ground fought
over and the tremendous obstacles to be overcome,
it is obvious that there was no time for varying
fortunes.  By the very perfection and glory of the
achievement the story of it must suffer.
</p>

<p>
Envisaged as a whole, the action may best be
presented as the steady onflow of our waves close
behind the successive lifts of our barrage.  The
movement was as deliberate and as strictly co-ordinated
as if it were being executed on the parade-ground;
for the enemy's fury of shell and machine-guns,
though it could slash gaps in our lines, could
not either check or hurry their inexorable march.
Now here, now there, the lines would break into a
little seething vortex of body-to-body struggle as
they swept around and engulfed some rock of
obstinate resistance.  But for the most part these
stubborn points were left to the uncompromising
attention of the New Brunswickers, whose "mopping
up" was thorough; and, having confidence in
that thoroughness, the attacking lines refused to be
delayed, but bombed and bayoneted their way
straight on to their final objective.  They gained it,
and the most furious counter-attacks which an able
and hardy enemy could afterwards hurl against it
never availed to shake their grip upon it.
</p>

<p>
To grasp the details of the action it is necessary
to follow the fortunes of the attacking Battalions
individually.  The total depth covered in the
advance, as we have seen, was about 3,000 yards,
and every yard of it under heavy shelling.  The
22nd Battalion, on the right, led by Lieutenant-Colonel
Tremblay, the Battalion Commander, in
person, negotiated this portion of the advance in
extended order at three paces interval (that is, in
non-technical language, in an open line with a space
of three yards between man and man).  The two
leading companies in this formation occupied a front
of about 900 yards.  One hundred and fifty yards
behind them, in the same formation, came the other
two companies of the Battalion.  Two hundred
yards behind them, again, came two companies of
the 26th Battalion, also in two lines, to do the
mopping up for their predecessors.
</p>

<p>
This first thin line, looking frail and inadequate
indeed for the great task before it, moved on through
the storm of death as steadily as if upon manoeuvres.
But even upon manoeuvres it is difficult enough for
a line so extended to maintain formation and
direction.  Now, with great gaps blown in it here and
there, and each individual compelled to thread his
way between endless shell-holes, some old and cold,
some still smoking with poison fumes, the line took
ground insensibly to the right and fell off toward
Martinpuich.  Its left was losing touch with the 25th
Battalion across the Bapaume Road.  Colonel
Tremblay, perceiving the error in time, doubled
across the whole front, swung up the right flank,
and got the line once more facing its true objective.
Three times he was thrown down and half-buried
by shells exploding near him, but impatiently
recovering himself he continued to guide the attack.
The Battalion swept over the heads of the surprised
4th Brigade in Candy Trench, and then, pivoting
on the Sugar Refinery, whirled to the left till its
right rested on Gun Pit Trench.  Fronting now due
north, with shouts and cheers and shrill cries of
exultation the excited French-Canadians stormed
forward into Courcelette.
</p>

<p>
In their eagerness, these dark little men from the
docks of Montreal were hardly to be restrained.
They entered the outskirts of the village fairly on
the heels of their own barrage, and suffered some
loss from it before it lifted forward.  The platoons
of their extreme right ran into a torrent of machine-gun
fire, which took heavy toll of them.  But as soon
these guns were located the little men were on
to them like wild-cats, and from that quarter there
was no further trouble.
</p>

<p>
The progress of the Battalion through the village
was, in the main, one irresistible rush, scarcely
delayed by the savage hand-to-hand encounters which
developed all along its progress.  Here and there
a party of two or three would delay, perforce, to
unearth and destroy a dangerous sniper's post or to
bomb a threatening dug-out.  But for the most part
the front waves passed straight on, their left
bounded by the main street running north, their
right by the trenches outside the sunken road which
forms the eastern limit of the village.  They were
not in the mood for stopping to take prisoners in
their haste, but they gathered in about 300,
unwounded, as they went.  By 6.45 they had pushed
clean through the maze of houses and established
their lines clear beyond the Stone Quarry, which
occupies the extreme north-eastern apex of Courcelette.
They had utterly overthrown, destroyed, or
captured a garrisoning force numerically superior to
themselves and holding all the advantages of position
and preparation.
</p>

<p>
This kind of fighting, this battling through the
maze of half-ruined cottages, wrecked gardens, and
tumbled walls was exactly to the taste of these eager
and wiry Montreal Frenchmen.  The variety of it,
the scope it offered to individual adventure, appealed
to them.  Into such individual adventure they threw
themselves with zest.  A fiery sergeant, having
captured a store of German bombs, loaded himself with
them and set out to put them to the best possible
use.  He bombed a dug-out crowded with Huns.
He rushed on to another and cleaned it up with
equal effectiveness.  He then, still single-handed
attacked a third, but was shot down before he
could throw his bomb.  In spite of the heavy
casualties which they suffered from beginning
to end of their advance, the French-Canadians
carried it through at a pitch of enthusiasm
which made devotion easy and sacrifice of no
account.  But having thus gained their prize, the
holding of it was presently to prove a more searching
test of their quality.  Throughout the next forty-eight
hours they were to show, under terrible trial,
as we shall see, a tenacity, an endurance, and a
toughness of fibre no less admirable than the fire
and <i>élan</i> of their attack.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, how had it been faring with the 25th
Battalion, the men of Nova Scotia, on the left?
The objective set them, it will be remembered, was
that portion of Courcelette&mdash;the larger portion,
as will be seen by reference to the map&mdash;which lay
west of the principal street running north and south.
Courcelette at this time, though much damaged, was
still recognisable as a village.  There were still
streets to fight through, still houses and walls to
serve as ambush for machine-gun or sniper.  And
the village church in the main street still stood, still
held aloft its ancient spire, which was the landmark
to guide the right flank of the Nova Scotians' line.
It was the ceaseless&mdash;and futile&mdash;German bombardment
of the place, after it had passed once for all
into our hands, which pounded Courcelette into the
dust and made of her one stony desolation with
Pozières, Ovillers, and La Boiselle.
</p>

<p>
The first wave of the 25th Battalion was led by
its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel
E. Hilliam.  It was made up of "D" and "A"
companies, led by their respective company commanders,
Major Brooks and Major Tupper.  And it occupied,
in extended order, a frontage of about half a mile.
For the work before it this line was daringly thin,
but the coolness and steadiness of these Nova
Scotian men fully justified the confidence of their
leader, and the wide extension of the line kept down
the casualties in passing through the heavy German
barrage.  In spite of this furious shelling; and the
tortured ground to be traversed (which was nothing
more than a jumble of shell-holes), this difficult
formation was preserved as methodically as it on
inspection parade, the whole battalion responding
to its leader as a well-tuned machine responds to
the touch of the operator.
</p>

<p>
At a distance of 600 yards from the village
the advance came under very heavy machine-gun
fire, and Major Brooks, who was leading D
Company, the left half of the line, was killed, as
was also Captain Dickey, the Adjutant, who
accompanied Colonel Hilliam.  Through this destructive
fire the line swept on unwavering, without either
delay or haste, to within 200 yards of the first houses.
It was from among these houses that the stream of
leaden death was issuing.  Colonel Hilliam gave the
word to charge, and the position&mdash;consisting of the
whole southern outskirts of the village from the
main street on the right, to the sunken road on the
left&mdash;was captured with a rush.  In this rush one of
the enemy's machine-guns was taken, but the rest
were successfully carried off by the survivors of
their crews into the more northerly portion of the
village.
</p>

<p>
The Nova Scotians were now somewhat ahead of
their scheduled time&mdash;so much so, indeed, that they
were beginning to get peppered with fragments from
their own barrage.  Colonel Hilliam, therefore,
halted them, under cover of the cottages and garden
walls, to take breath for the next thrust.  He moved
through the ranks, talking to each man personally,
and found that, in spite of their casualties, they had
small need of cheering or encouragement.  Amid
toppling walls and hurtling death and a
pandemonium that no words can describe, they were
smoking and chaffing as if their halt was a mere
route-march rest along a peaceful roadside.  But
under this gay and laughing surface was the thrill
of a fierce exultation, and, in the words of their
commander, they were "like hounds straining on the
leash" for the renewal of the attack.  A few minutes
more and the barrage lifted.  The leash was loosed.
The front line burst forward, and, bearing down
all opposition in its rush, swept straight through
to its objective, 300 yards beyond the northern
boundary of the village.  Here they at once began
to dig in, and so judicious was the siting of their
trenches that the enemy's artillery did not succeed
in locating them till the next day.  Colonel Hilliam,
though wounded, remained on duty, personally
supervising the task of consolidation.  The second
line, some fifty yards behind, came on more
deliberately, finishing what its predecessor had left
half-done, and taking up its position in support of
the first.  Numbers of the enemy were seen fleeing
wildly up the slope and over the crest of the ridge
beyond the village.  They were pursued at once by
the deadly individual fire of our sharpshooters and
by the collective fire of certain sections working as
fire-units as deliberately as if at range practice
Though bomb and bayonet had been their chief
weapons of late, the men had not forgotten the fine
points of their musketry, and it was but a thin
remnant of the fugitives that escaped over the ridge.
These sons of Nova Scotia had proved themselves
to be of the same indomitable temper as their
forbears in "the land of the glens and the mountains
and the heroes."  They had displayed that blend
of cold resolution and fighting fire which we
associate with such storied Scottish regiments as the
Gordons and the Black Watch.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later the Montreal men, enveloping
the Stone Quarry, had joined up on the right.  This
was at 7 o'clock in the evening of the 15th.  The
whole of Courcelette was in our hands, and our grip
was locked upon it, never to be shaken loose.
</p>

CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<h4>
HOLDING THE NEW GROUND
</h4>

<p>
Meanwhile, the 26th Battalion, the men of New
Brunswick, under Lieutenant-Colonel A. E. G. McKenzie,
though denied the exultation of the first
irresistible onward sweep to victory, were none the
less getting their fill of hard fighting and contributing
their full share to the splendid achievement
of the day.  They came in for sharp punishment,
too in passing through the barrage which the enemy
had promptly put up for the purpose of walling off
the assault from its support.  And the task which
had been set them, of "mopping up" behind the
assaulting waves proved to be a long, strenuous, and
costly one.  As the first waves of our attack raged
across the village, numbers of the enemy flung
away their rifles in panic, shouted the customary
Kamerad!  Kamerad!" and held up their hands
in surrender.  They were spared, and ordered to go
back behind the lines.  But after the wave had
passed on, many of these, though essentially
prisoners on parole, picked up their rifles again and
fell to sniping our troops in the rear from convenient
hiding-places in the gardens and cellars.  When the
New Brunswickers came along these traitors usually
put up a desperate fight, having little reason to
expect further mercy.  The New Brunswickers,
however, in spite of their many casualties, were in a
triumphant mood and not inclined to inquire too
closely into the deserts of their captives; and those
who made haste to surrender again got the benefit
of the doubt.  All this business of "mopping up"
gave opportunity for individual prowess, and the
woodsmen and river-men, small farmers and
independent townsmen of the sturdy Loyalist province
threw themselves into it with peculiar zeal.  By
nightfall their task was nominally complete, and
Colonel McKenzie was able to throw two of his
companies into the trenches on the right of
Courcelette in support of the 22nd Battalion, while the
other two companies he posted on the left to support
the 25th.  But during all that night and the greater
part of the following day he had small parties out
scouring the ruins and the cellars, unearthing fresh
dug-outs and discovering craftily-hidden sniping-posts.
The Battalion suffered in all about 300
casualties, of whom 11 were officers.  But the
casualties which they inflicted upon the enemy,
chiefly in their fierce bombing and bayonet work,
were very heavy, and of unwounded prisoners alone
they took just over 600, making a sufficiently
handsome balance to their credit.  General McDonnell,
in a letter to Colonel McKenzie immediately after
the relief of the Battalion, wrote: "New Brunswick
may justly be thrilled with pride at the deeds
done by her lads in this particular fight."
</p>

<p>
As the 25th Battalion had taken about 300
prisoners, and the 22nd approximately the same
number, during their final sweep through the village,
the total of prisoners to the credit of the 5th Brigade
in this brief and brilliant action amounted to about
1,200, exclusive of the wounded.  Among these
prisoners were two colonels, one a regimental and
the other a battalion commander.  There was also
substantial booty, including three 4.1 guns, seven
machine-guns, seven trench-mortars, a locomotive
and several railway trucks, with quantities of bombs,
ammunition, and stores.
</p>

<p>
The village having thus been carried by storm,
with such fine <i>élan</i> and disciplined valour, by the
men of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec,
the exultant victors had now an even sterner test to
undergo.  During three nights and two days they
had to hold what they had gained against the most
desperate efforts of a powerful and exasperated
adversary to retake it.  For this duty the 5th Brigade
was reinforced by two additional Battalions, the
18th from the 4th Brigade and the 27th from the
6th; and General McDonnell was given command
of the whole divisional front.  On their right the
15th Division (Imperials), pounding their way
onward through the twin village of Martinpuich, had
kept an even front with the Canadian advance.  But
on their left the progress of the 3rd Division had
been delayed by a formidable trench system known
as the Fabeck Graben.  The captured village,
therefore, constituted the point of a dangerous wedge
driven defiantly into the heart of the German
position.  It was not only a salient narrow and awkward,
therefore, which General McDonnell, on this night
of the triumphant September 15th, found himself
called upon to consolidate and to hold, but it was
one which both invited assault by its exposure and
insistently challenged by its menace.  Throughout
the night, however, the enemy made no response
to the challenge except by incessant shelling, their
infantry, apparently, being for the time too much
demoralised to face the conquerors again.  By the
afternoon of the 16th they had recovered, and being
heavily reinforced, they made a desperate effort to
recover their lost ground.  From the trenches which
they still held on the right of our position, by the
cemetery, and from the direction of Destremont
Farm, they launched no fewer than seven counterattacks
upon the apex and the eastern side of the
salient.  This, as we have seen, was the frontage
held by the French-Canadian Battalion, worn and
weary, but elated by its dashing successes of the
previous evening.  Supported by a portion of the New
Brunswick Battalion on their right, and by a strong
advanced post from the Nova Scotian Battalion on
their left front, the French-Canadians beat off all
these assaults without yielding up a foot of their
hard-won ground.  In the meantime the Nova
Scotians were dealing drastically with four
counterattacks against their own front where they had
hastily but thoroughly consolidated themselves along
a line several hundred yards beyond the north-western
outskirts of the village.  It was during this
consolidation that an adventurous Nova Scotian
bomber&mdash;by name Private McIntyre&mdash;went scouting
up a section of German trench, encountered a party
of twelve Germans, coolly summoned them to
surrender and marched them all in as prisoners.  The
results of these counter-attacks against the Nova
Scotians were so unsatisfactory to the enemy that he
did not repeat them, but turned his attention once
more to the north-eastern face of the position, where
the fact that he still held, with abundance of
machine-guns, an obscure tangle of trenches between the
Quarry and the Bapaume Road seemed to offer him
better prospects of success.  Here the 22nd Battalion,
and the 26th, who had taken over the frontage
between the Cemetery and the Bapaume Road to enable
the diminished companies of the 22nd to shorten their
line, on the nights of the 16th and 17th hurled back
six more counter-attacks which were pressed with
fierce determination.  Upon the failure of these the
Germans appeared sullenly to accept the loss of
Courcelette, and confined themselves to harassing us
with shell-fire and sniping.  They found themselves
fully occupied in blocking our ceaseless efforts to
gnaw our way ever a little farther along the left of
the road.  On the afternoon of the 17th these efforts
developed into a sharp attack by the 22nd and 24th
Battalions upon that troublesome maze of trenches
already referred to, just beyond the Cemetery.
This attack was successful upon its left and centre,
but was held up on its right by overwhelming
machine-gun fire.  It resulted, however, in a decided
improvement of our position on the exposed eastern
flank of the village.
</p>

<p>
While the 22nd and 24th Battalions were making
this attempt on the right the Nova Scotians threw
forward one company and a party of bombers on the
left, endeavouring to seize a swell of ground just
north of their lines.  Though a minor attack, the
men of Nova Scotia pressed it with great determination,
their recent successes having rendered them unwilling
to acknowledge that any obstacle could baulk
them.  This time, however, they found themselves
held up, and were forced to draw back into their
trenches after heavy casualties.  Encouraged by this
small flicker of success, the enemy sought to follow
it up by a series of counter-attacks.  As these grew
more and more severe the reserve company of the
New Brunswickers (the 26th Battalion) was thrown in
to take a hand in the strenuous game.  This went on
throughout the night.  Finally, during the progress
of the heaviest counter-attack of all, a company of
the 4th Battalion, 1st Brigade, came up to begin the
relief; and the enemy was hurled back with severe
punishment.  On the morning of the 18th, the 2nd
Division, battle-weary but triumphant and covered
with distinction, was relieved, and drew off for a few
days in rest camp at Rubempré; while the veteran
1st Division took over its proud lines on the left.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to conclude the story of the
winning of Courcelette without paying tribute to the
heroic and extraordinarily efficient work of the
Canadian Engineer and Pioneer companies throughout
the whole course of the struggle.  In consolidating our
newly-won positions, in siting and digging communication
trenches, in running up light railways to the
new front, they laboured under the severe and
incessant scouring of shell and machine-gun fire and
endured heavy casualties without the stimulus of
being able to strike back at their opponents.  The
daring and devotion of the Field Ambulance Service
were such as to make all praise seem poor; and the
deeds of heroic sacrifice in the rescue of the wounded
were not less splendid than those enacted in the
fighting itself.  Among those who gave their lives in
this noble work was the gallant officer directing it in
the forward area, Lieutenant-Colonel R. P. Campbell,
who fell in the hail of shrapnel.  The arduous
duties of carrying food and supplies for the fighting
lines, throughout the engagement, were performed, at
heavy cost, by the 24th Battalion, which thus
contributed in fullest measure to the victory&mdash;and the
casualty list&mdash;though deprived, except during the
operation on the afternoon of the 17th, of its hoped-for
share in the fighting.  The gratitude of their
fellow battalions, whose hands they so efficiently
upheld, had to compensate them for their loss of the
acclaim and exaltation of the great attack.
</p>

<p>
Of the 22 officers who went into the attack with
the French-Canadian Battalion (the 22nd), 6 were
killed and 11 wounded; and the Nova Scotian
Battalion, by a curious coincidence, suffered the
same number of casualties among its officers, viz.,
5 killed, 8 wounded, and 4 missing&mdash;in all, 17
officer casualties for each of the two Battalions.
With the 11 already noted in the 26th Battalion,
9 in the 24th,[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] 2 in the 5th Canadian Machine-Gun
Company, 1 brigade bombing officer, and 1
O.C. Trench-Mortar Battery, we have a total of 58 officer
casualties in the Brigade incurred during the actual
operations of the 16th, 17th, and 18th.  Of other
ranks our casualties numbered 1,267.

CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<h4>
MOUQUET FARM
</h4>

<p>
Though it was to the 2nd Canadian Division the
distinction fell of taking Courcelette, this signal
triumph would not have been possible but for the
simultaneous attacks of the 3rd Canadian Division
on their left, across McDonnell Road.  These
attacks resulted, at the moment, in no great gain of
ground, but they effectually held the attention of the
Germans in the Fabeck Graben and Zollern Trench,
and so protected the flank of the 2nd Division's
advance.  This, indeed, was all that it was intended to
accomplish, the duty assigned to the 3rd Division
in orders being merely to carry out such operations as
might be necessary to protect the left flank of the
main offensive.  The task with which the Divisional
Commander (Major-General L. J. Lipsett, C.M.G.)
found himself confronted was an arduous one for he
had peculiarly difficult ground before him, and such
formidable defensive positions as Mouquet Farm
and the Fabeck Graben and Zollern trenches; but it
was accomplished with complete success, though not
without heavy cost in casualties.
</p>

<p>
It was on September 7th that the 3rd Division
moved south from Steenvoorde toward the region of
the Somme, assembling in the neighbourhood of
Cramont and Colon Villers.  On the 10th they
transferred to the Reserve area at Rubempré; and on the
12th they moved up into the fighting area, on the
left of the 2nd Division, with headquarters at Usna
Hill.  On their left they had the 11th (Imperial)
Division.  The 8th Brigade (Brigadier-General
J. H. Elmsley, D.S.O.) went first into the trenches,
beyond the ruins of Pozières; while the 7th Brigade
held itself in readiness at Vadincourt, and the 9th
at Herissart.  The Brigade was made up of the 1st,
2nd, 4th, and 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles.  The
2nd and 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles were sent into
the front trenches with the 1st in support at Chalk
Pits, and 5th in reserve among the mounds of <i>débris</i>
which had been La Boiselle.  The task of taking
over these front lines in the dark, by men totally
unfamiliar with the lay of the land, over a wilderness
of shell-holes and old, ruined trenches, where all
landmarks had been obliterated, and through a hell
of shrapnel, gas and high explosives, was in itself
equivalent to a battle, and calculated to shake the
morale of any troops but those of the finest nerve.  It
was accomplished not without loss, and vicissitude,
and much thrilling adventure.
</p>

<p>
That same night of the 12th, hoping to profit by
the confusion attending the taking over of the lines,
the enemy launched a sudden attack from Mouquet
Farm, upon the left sector of the divisional front,
at the same time putting up a heavy barrage to
prevent the supports from coming up from the Chalk
Pits.  The attack fell upon the 2nd Canadian
Mounted Rifles (under Lieutenant-Colonel Bott),
who now, after their fighting in the north,
numbered only about 250 bayonets.  It was a rude
welcome to this fiercely contested line, where the
struggle had been wavering back and forth for days;
but the battalion was a seasoned one, and was not
caught unready.  With the aid of the Artillery and
light trench mortars the assailants, after an obstinate
effort, were beaten back with heavy loss.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the 14th, the 1st and 5th
Battalions of the Canadian Mounted Rifles were in the
divisional front trenches (having relieved the 2nd
and 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles), when the 11th
Division, on our left, made an attack.  The Germans
retaliated by a counter-attack upon our sector.  Our
men had hot work for a time; and the help of the
Canadian heavy guns was called in with effect.  By
half-past nine the attack had been beaten back, with
much more loss to the enemy, on this occasion, than
to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th began the long series of gruelling
struggles which, with varied fortunes and cruel losses,
was to keep the 3rd Division under almost ceaseless
strain throughout the next four weeks, until its
withdrawal, with the 1st and 2nd Divisions, from the
Somme area.  According to the plan of operations
for the great offensive on the 15th, the part assigned
to the 3rd Division was, as has been noted, to form
a protecting left flank to the offensive.  This was to
be effected by a thrust against the Fabeck Graben
and Zollern trench systems; by running out a trench
and establishing a strong post on the extreme right,
so as to obtain an enfilading fire of machine-guns
along the front of the 2nd Division's objective (thus
taking a direct hand in the attack on Courcelette);
and by raiding the trench system around that ancient
thorn in our side, Mouquet Farm, with a view to
lessening the German pressure further to the right.
The duty of carrying out these operations was
allotted to the 8th Brigade, which was already in
occupation of our front lines west of McDonnell
Road.
</p>

<p>
At 6.30 on the morning of the 15th the first move
in the attack was made.  The 5th Canadian Mounted
Rifles (Lieutenant-Colonel Draper), on the right,
rushed their first objective, the German front
line, so swiftly that it was gained with few
casualties.  They jammed the enemy back up
his communication trench some distance and
established a block.  Their gain was quickly
consolidated and they set themselves to digging a new
communication trench back to our lines.  At the
same time the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles
(Lieutenant-Colonel Andross), on the left, sprung
their raid on Mouquet Farm.  They gained
entrance, after a brief resistance, and found
the place full of German dead, the harvest of our
barrage.  Having hastily effected such damage as
they could with the explosives at their disposal, they
made their way back to their starting point, with one
prisoner, having suffered only 25 casualties in the
affair, which had lasted just about one hour.  They
had no sooner evacuated the farm than the German
artillery came down upon it with a tornado of shells,
which inflicted much more damage than our raiders
had been able to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
So far all had gone well; and now news came
across of the unexpectedly swift and brilliant success
of the 4th and 6th Brigades in their attack on the
approaches to Courcelette.  Toward 10 o'clock it
was decided, by telephone conference between
General Byng and the Divisional Commander, that,
as the 2nd Division was to proceed to the capture of
Courcelette in the afternoon, the 3rd Division should
simultaneously undertake a further advance, with
the object of seizing, not only Fabeck Graben, but
the crest of the low ridge beyond it.  From this
position, if they could attain it, they would not only
support and protect the further advance of the 2nd
Division on Courcelette, but overlook and threaten
the formidable lines of Zollern Trench.  For this
venture the 8th Brigade shortened its line toward the
left, and the 7th Brigade, hurrying up from Usna
Hill, moved into the trenches on the right, forming
contact with the left of the 2nd Division at Taffy
Trench.  The greater portion of the responsibility
for the new attack thus devolved, very fittingly, upon
the 7th Brigade, which came in fresh for the contest
while the 8th had already been under three days and
nights of trial.  The interest of the story at this
point, therefore, centres chiefly about the fortunes
of the 7th Brigade under its able commander,
Brigadier-General A. C. MacDonell, C.M.U., D.S.O.
</p>

<p>
The disposition of the Brigade for the attack was
as follows: The right half of the attacking wave
was taken by the "Princess Pats," under Lieutenant-Colonel
Pelly, the left half by the 42nd Battalion
(the 5th Royal Highlanders of Canada from
Montreal), under Lieutenant-Colonel Cantlie.
Immediately beyond the centre of the attacking
line waited the 49th Battalion (the Edmonton
Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Griesbach).  The
plan was for the 42nd and the "Princess Pats" to
take the first two objectives and consolidate them.
The 49th was then to pass on through to the third
objective and dig in.  Behind the 40th, again, stood
the Royal Canadian Regiment, in support, under
Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Hill.  The plan was well
devised; but it was destined to encounter obstacles
which prevented its complete accomplishment.  In
one vital respect, however, its purpose was fully
attained.  It gave the enemy all he could do on
its front, thus perfectly, though at heavy cost,
protecting the flank of the 2nd Division, and rendering
possible the triumphant assault on Courcelette.  The
operation must, therefore, be accounted a complete
victory for the 3rd Division, which thereby achieved
what it was set to do in an entirely adequate manner,
although not gaining all the ground which it had
hoped to gain.
</p>

<p>
The task confronting the Brigade Commander at
the very outset was a sufficiently hard one.  He had
to bring up his Brigade over five miles of extremely
difficult and confusing ground, through a succession
of destructive barrages, and deploy it for attack in
broad daylight, in the very teeth of an enemy
in force and furiously alert, along an almost
shelterless frontage.  This was accomplished on time,
at 6 p.m.  The attack was launched as planned,
just at the moment when, to the right, the 5th
Brigade was starting its final victorious advance on
Courcelette.  The men of the 42nd Battalion reached
their first objective in fifteen minutes with comparatively
light casualties; and by half-past six they had
gained their portion of the second objective, the
formidable Fabeck Graben.  The "Princess Pats"
meanwhile had carried their first objective with a
rush; but running into a withering machine-gun fire
on their right, they were partially baulked of their
second objective.  Only the two platoons of their
left succeeded in getting into Fabeck Graben, where
they established themselves in touch with the 42nd.
On their right, for the next 200 yards or so, the
trench was still held by the enemy in force.  Beyond
them again the trench was occupied almost up to the
outskirts of Courcelette, by parties of the veteran
battalion, which had burst their way, with magnificent
audacity, through the hell of the machine-guns, and
were holding on to the precarious gains with the
tenacity of bulldogs.  The heroism of these scattered
groups was of incalculable service to the men of the
25th Battalion, then fighting their way through the
western half of Courcelette.
</p>

<p>
Soon after 8 o'clock the 49th Battalion started up
the sunken road on its way to attempt the third
objective; and the Royal Canadian Regiment,
supporting, took their places in the front line from which
the attack had been launched.  They got into Fabeck
Graben, and held on there; but concentrated artillery
fire and the massing of the Germans in Zollern
Trench, and especially about its junction with the
Fabeck Graben, made further progress for the
moment impossible.
</p>

<p>
To the 8th Brigade, on the left, had been set but
a single objective, namely, the more westerly sector
of Fabeck Graben, running in the direction of
Mouquet Farm.  But one battalion, the 4th Canadian
Mounted Rifles (from Eastern Canada, and
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel H. D. L. Gordon),
was appointed to this operation.  "B" and "C"
Companies formed the attacking waves.  But a
heavy blow fell upon them at the outset, which,
but for the ready initiative of the captain in
command of "B" Company, would have upset
the whole movement.  "B" Company gained
the jumping-off trench without mishap; but "C"
Company, which was a little way behind, was
caught fairly by the German barrage, just as it was
deploying from the communication trench known as
"Tom's Cut."  The result was disastrous.  Two of
the platoons were practically wiped out.  And the
remaining two platoons were forced to draw back
into the shelter of the trench.  Perceiving that the
whole operation of the Brigade was in jeopardy
through this misfortune, the captain of "B"
Company (Captain Coleman) came to a bold decision.
Extending his company to occupy the whole
frontage, he attacked at once, before the enemy
became aware of their advantage.  His thin wave
made up for its deficiency in weight by the fury
of its charge, burst into Fabeck Graben with
bomb and bayonet, and carried the whole objective.
Having secured his connection with the 7th Brigade
on his right, he fought his way some distance along
the trench to his left, and established a block to
protect his heroic handful from interference from the
direction of Mouquet Farm.  It was an altogether
notable feat, even among the many achievements of
that memorable day.  As soon as darkness fell, the
remaining two platoons of "C" Company moved up
into the captured position, a communication trench
was dug back to our lines, and patrols were sent out
toward Zollern Trench to guard against a surprise
counter-attack.  Throughout the affair the support
of our artillery left nothing to be desired.  Had it
not been for the fulness and accuracy of our barrage
the success of a single company extended over so
wide a frontage would have been impossible.
</p>

<p>
Fabeck Graben having been thus secured by the
3rd Division, it was decided that the Division should,
on the following day, the 16th, press on to the
assault on Zollern Trench and the strongly defended
position known as Zollern Redoubt, situated at a
commanding cross-roads, about half a mile due north
of Mouquet Farm, which had been giving us trouble
for so long that it had acquired an evil fame out of
all proportion to its importance.  The ground about
the farm was high, and peculiarly exposed to the
enemy's fire from north, north-east and east alike, so
that it was necessary to take not only the stronghold
itself but the rolling ground far in advance of it,
in order to be secure in its possession.  All previous
attacks upon it had been made from the south and
south-east; but now the plan was to attack from the
east.  To this end it was absolutely essential that the
eastern half of Zollern Trench should first be in our
hands.
</p>

<p>
The whole operation, as will be obvious from a
glance at the map, now depended on the gaining of
our first objective, namely, the line of Zollern Trench
east, as far west as Grandcourt Road.  With that
line in our possession, the way would be open to
attack both Zollern Redoubt and Mouquet Far,
with a reasonable chance of success.
</p>

<p>
The plan of operation was as follows: At 5 p.m. the
7th Brigade, which occupied the right of the line
was to capture Zollern Trench and secure their hold
upon it.  Then, but not till then, the 9th Brigade
(Brigadier-General F. W. Hill, D.S.O.) occupying
the centre of the line, was to swing its right
northward till it rested on Zollern Trench, and then move
westward against Zollern Redoubt.  This attack was
not timed to start till 6.30, to allow for the completion
of the movement of the 7th Brigade, upon which
it hinged.  The 8th Brigade, meanwhile, on the left,
was to undertake the task of encircling Mouquet
Farm on the east and north.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the afternoon all the proposed
objectives were subjected to a heavy bombardment, which
at 4.30 was intensified to a close barrage, behind the
shelter of which the assaulting battalions of the 7th
Brigade formed up for the attack.  At 5 p.m. the
first wave went over the top, the Royal Canadian
Regiment on the right, the 42nd Battalion (Royal
Highlanders, Montreal) on the left, with the 49th
Battalion (Edmonton) in support.
</p>

<p>
The attack was ably planned and launched with
the greatest resolution, but it met with an altogether
unexpected weight and fury of opposition.  It found
the enemy massed before it in unprecedented force,
and ran into a devastating storm of machine-gun fire
from left and front.  It turned out that the Germans
had gathered all their available strength on that
sector for an overwhelming counter-attack on
Courcelette.  The result was an unforeseen one for
both sides, a stalemate as far as these operations
were concerned.  The great counter-attack, which
might conceivably have wrenched Courcelette from
the grasp of its weary conquerors, was shattered
before it even got under way, and nothing was heard
of it thereafter on any such scale.  At the same time
our attacking waves broke in vain upon the fiery
parapets before them, and none gained an entrance
to the trench.
</p>

<p>
The 9th Brigade meanwhile had reached their
jumping-off trench, and were waiting impatiently to
move on Zollern Redoubt.  The appointed hour
went by; but the Zollern Trench was still in the
enemy's hands, and they could not start.  In this
crisis the commander of the 7th Brigade ordered up
his supporting battalion, the 49th, to add its weight
to the attacking line.  The enemy's barrages were
so intense that the signal wires were all broken, and
the order had to be sent through by runners.  For
these runners, too, as ill chance would have it, the
barrages proved equally destructive, and the order
never reached the 49th till 11 o'clock.  By that time
it was too late, and the order had been already
cancelled.  In the meantime, the leading battalion
of the 9th Brigade had sent three platoons to the
aid of the hard-pressed 42nd.  General Hill had not
yet given up hope of getting his blow in against the
Zollern Redoubt and he asked that the artillery
should keep up their barrage on the redoubt till
7.30, which was done.  By this time, however, it was
clear that the 7th Brigade had been baulked.  Thus
disorganised in its foundations the whole attack fell
through and was abandoned, and our battalions,
angry and bleeding, drew back into their own lines.
</p>

<p>
As far as the object with which it was undertaken
is concerned, the operation was a confessed failure.
But inasmuch as it brought to naught the great
German counter-attack the failure was not without its
compensations, and the account may be regarded as
fairly squared.  At the same time, while the major
operation had thus missed its aim, a very important
success had been scored for the Division by the 8th
Brigade, on the extreme left.  The 2nd Canadian
Mounted Rifles, during the night of the 16th-17th,
took Mouquet Farm.  A party, under Major Foster,
bombed the Germans out of a trench which covered
the north side of the Farm, consolidated it, and
established two machine-gun and bombing posts.
Then other parties of the battalion entered the Farm
itself, and blew up the dug-outs, wherein the garrison
was sheltering.  Among these dug-outs one was
discovered which threw light upon the source of
many past reverses.  A cunningly concealed tunnel
led northward from it to a maze of German trenches
outside.  By this tunnel, when Australians or
Imperials had captured Mouquet Farm on previous
occasions, the Germans had been wont to steal in
with machine-guns and bombs and take them in the
rear.  Now, this tunnel was effectually closed by
exploding a Stokes gun shell within it, and the
enemy beyond were sealed away from further
mischief.

<br />
Map&mdash;MOUQUET FARM.  Progressive Stages, Sept. 3rd 14th 16th.
</p>

<p>
In a few hours a new trench was dug, completely
surrounding the Farm, and the stronghold so
drenched with blood, so often won and lost again,
so long a menace to our lines on the south and east,
was at last securely in our hands.  Before daylight
the Canadian Mounted Rifles handed it over,
with pardonable exultation, to a relieving Battalion
of the 11th (Imperial) Division.  On this day the
8th Brigade moved back to the Brickfields at Albert,
and the 7th to Tara Hill; and the 9th Brigade took
over their lines.  The next few days were occupied
with sharp but fluctuating struggles, carried out by
the 1st Division on the right around Courcelette
and the 3rd Division on the left, which yielded no
permanent result except the improvement of our
position between Courcelette and the Bapaume
Road, and a slight but valuable gain of ground
along the northern outskirts of the village, towards
Kenora Trench.  Zollern Graben still defied us.
Though it was taken on the 20th, for an extent of
250 yards, by the 43rd (Cameron Highlanders of
Canada, Winnipeg), and 58th (Toronto) Battalions,
we were not yet able to maintain our hold upon it.
These confusing and sanguinary struggles may be
regarded as leading up to and preparing the way
for the next great series of operations, which aimed
at, and at last, after bitter cost, resulted in, the
capture of Regina Trench.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<h4>
REGINA
</h4>

<p>
The two outstanding features of the Canadian
Corps operations on the Somme in the late summer
and autumn of 1916 are undoubtedly the capture
of Courcelette and the grim struggle for Regina
Trench, but nothing could be greater than the
contrast between the two.  Courcelette, as we have seen,
was captured by a swift and sudden operation,
perfectly planned and brilliantly executed&mdash;a clear-cut
victory without flaw or hitch.  On the other hand, the
Canadians fought for over a month to obtain
possession of Regina, attacking again and again
according to carefully laid plans, sometimes to gain by
sheer valour a temporary footing in the trench, only
to be hurled back, fighting stubbornly, by
overwhelming numbers; at other times to face
unsuspected and murderous machine-gun fire which
almost wiped the assaulting platoons out of
existence.  Yet each successive attack pushed won
a little nearer to the goal, until at last, after a
month and more of harassing vicissitudes, a final
rush secured the victory.
</p>

<p>
Regina Trench first came within the scope of
Canadian operations during the offensive of
September 26th and 27th, when it was the ultimate
objective of the attack.  At no time, however, did
the attacking troops get within striking distance of
this last objective.
</p>

<p>
It was on October 1st that the first elaborate
and comprehensive attack was made, in
conjunction with the III Corps on the right and
the II Corps on the left.  The Canadian line
at this date ran from the north-western corner
of Destremont Farm in a general westerly
direction, with a large loop to the north around the
North Practice Trenches, to the junction of
Grandcourt Road and the recently captured Hessian
Trench.  From this point the line followed Hessian
Trench westward to the Corps boundary on the
left, a short distance west of the junction with
Courcelette Road.  The task set the Corps was to
occupy a line from the above-mentioned point at
Destremont Farm north-westerly to the junction of
Regina Trench and East Miraumont Road, thence
along Regina to a road running north and south
near the Corps' left boundary, where the line bent
back sharply to the Hessian Trench line.
</p>

<p>
The portion of Regina Trench which lies to the
east of the junction with East Miraumont Road was
not included in the scheme of operations.
</p>

<p>
There were seven Battalions in the line of attack.
These were, from right to left, the 20th and 18th
of the 4th Brigade, the 22nd, 25th, and 24th of the
5th Brigade, and the 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles
and the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles of the 8th
Brigade.  Thus the 2nd Division, on the right, had
five Battalions of two Brigades in the line, and the
3rd Division, on the left, had two Battalions of one
Brigade taking part in the assault.
</p>

<p>
It will be as well, perhaps, to describe the general
result of the action before attempting to follow the
fortunes of each Battalion in detail.  The greatest
measure of success was attained on the right, where
the line was advanced some 500 yards in such a
manner that both flanks of the 4th Brigade line were
brought up in line with the loop around the North
Practice Trenches in the centre of the Brigade
area.  In the centre the 5th Brigade managed to
maintain itself for a time in Regina Trench, but
was afterwards forced to retire.  It succeeded,
however, in capturing and holding Kenora Trench up
to within sixty yards of the junction with Regina,
and held posts up Courcelette Trench and the West
Miraumont Road about half-way between their
attacking line and Regina.  The Canadian Mounted
Rifles of the 8th Brigade on the left also succeeded
in reaching Regina at several points.  Heavily
counter-attacked, they managed to hold on for a
considerable time, but in the end they were driven
back to their starting line in the Hessian Trench.
</p>

<p>
At 3.15 p.m. on October 1st&mdash;a clear, bright
day&mdash;the attack was launched.  The 20th and 18th
Battalions, on the right, advanced respectively 400
and 500 yards over the open.  This brilliant feat,
comparable to the famous advance over the open
at Courcelette, was only rendered possible by the
cover afforded by the shell-holes.  In spite of
severe machine-gun fire from the direction of Pys
and Le Sars, the 20th had established themselves
in their position, with their flanks formed, before
their flanking battalions, the Imperial on the right
and the 18th on the left, had come up.  They had
advanced to a point about 150 yards N.N.W. of
their true objective, which would account for the
fact that the 18th Battalion appeared to be behind
them to the left.  This was the situation on the
morning of October 2nd.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the 18th had advanced and dug in.
Their left, however, was in a very critical position,
for the 22nd Battalion&mdash;the right battalion of the
5th Brigade&mdash;had not come up.  The French
Canadians, assaulting with their usual dash and
intrepidity, had encountered a withering machine-gun
and rifle fire from the front and flanks.  A few who
reached Regina Trench were either killed or
captured.  A few wounded managed to return to our
lines.  So badly had the Battalion been cut up that
the 26th (New Brunswickers), in close support, took
over that part of the line.
</p>

<p>
The 25th Battalion (Nova Scotians), the centre
battalion of the 5th Brigade, stormed Kenora Trench
and moved on steadily towards Regina.  Machine-gun
fire from front and flanks took heavy toll of
them, but those remaining reached the wire in front
of Regina and started to dig in.  A few odd parties
actually succeeded in forcing their way into Regina.
After fighting desperately for some time in an
endeavour to connect up with the 24th on their left,
they were nearly all killed or taken prisoners.  A
few managed to return wounded to the lines.
</p>

<p>
The right company of the 24th Battalion
(Victoria Rifles of Canada) crossed Kenora
Trench and entered Regina east of the
junction of Kenora and Regina, and the centre and
left companies succeeded in reaching their
objective in Regina Trench with their left on
Twenty-three Road.  They were separated from the 25th
on their right by a strong enemy post, and on
the left, owing to the repulse of the 5th Canadian
Mounted Rifles, their flank was in the air.  Furious
fighting ensued in Regina Trench from Twenty-three
Road to Kenora.  "A" Company, which had
entered Regina just east of the junction with
Kenora, fought fiercely against superior numbers.
Eventually what was left of them&mdash;for the majority
were either killed or captured&mdash;retired foot by foot.
Batmen, cooks, and servants were hurried up to help
stem the overflowing tide of Germans.  On the left
the Battalion was pushed back from Twenty-three
Road to a short distance from the junction of Kenora
and Regina Trenches.  Here a dogged stand was
made.  Meanwhile, a few small parties of the 24th
and 25th, who were digging in in front of Regina,
east of the trench junction, gradually retired to
Kenora.  The whole of Regina remained in the
hands of the enemy with the exception of a post
held by the 24th between the point where Kenora
and Regina join and Twenty-three Road.  During
this struggle the 26th, holding the original line of
the 22nd with the remnants of that Battalion, could
spare very little in the way of reinforcements, only
some fifty of all ranks being available.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the 8th Brigade, on the left,
had been having a very rough time.  From reports
received very shortly before the attack took place
it became evident that in many places the wire in
front of Regina had not been thoroughly cut by
the artillery.  This was especially the case on the
front assigned to the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles,
whose left attack had to be modified in consequence.
</p>

<p>
The Brigade attacked with the 5th Canadian
Mounted Rifles on the right and the 4th Canadian
Mounted Rifles on the left.  The right of the right
attacking company of the 5th Canadian Mounted
Rifles was held up by wire and ran into terrific
machine-gun fire.  The left attack came under heavy
fire about 50 yards from its objective, but as no
further opposition was encountered, it effected a
lodgment in Regina.  Work was immediately started
on the badly-damaged trench, and blocks were put in
on the flanks.  And not a moment too soon.  Repeated
counter-attacks were made, all of which were
successfully repulsed, excellent use being made of a
captured machine-gun.
</p>

<p>
The right company of the 4th Canadian Mounted
Rifles' attack, with the exception of one platoon
which was hung up by wire, apparently reached its
objective, but heavy counter-attacks from the
direction of the sunken road were too much for its
depleted strength.
</p>

<p>
The left of the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles was
forced to modify its assault on account of the uncut
wire.  A very unusual scheme of attack was adopted.
After moving down the communication trench the
attackers deployed on the German side of the wire.
Unfortunately, a heavy enfilading machine-gun fire
from the north-east and north-west wrecked the
attack.  One platoon, immediately to the west,
advancing with the greatest resolution, was almost
wiped out, and a bombing party which succeeded in
effecting an entry into Regina was at length forced
to retire.
</p>

<p>
With the exception, therefore, of the successful
advance of the 4th Brigade on the right, the situation
during the afternoon was that at various points
in Regina desperate hand-to-hand fighting was
taking place.
</p>

<p>
At 6.30 p.m. the state of affairs was approximately
as follows.  The 4th Brigade was consolidating
its position and attempting to gain touch with
the 70th Brigade on the right.  Parties of the 24th
and 25th Battalions were in Regina Trench, fighting
manfully against superior numbers and bombing
towards each other against the enemy, who appeared
to be in considerable strength at the junction of
Kenora and Regina Trenches.  Between the East
and West Miraumont Roads the situation was
obscure, as the result of the attack of the 22nd
Battalion had not yet been accurately ascertained.
They were thought to be in their objective, whereas,
as we have seen, they encountered machine-gun and
rifle fire of such intensity that success was out of
the question.  Yet they had managed to push the
assault home, for about 50 men entered Regina and
were only forced to retire after a short, sharp fight
against overwhelming odds.
</p>

<p>
At the same time the left company of the 5th
Canadian Mounted Rifles ("A" Company),
reinforced by parties from "C" and "D" Companies,
was fighting desperately to maintain its foothold in
Regina.  Repeated counter-attacks were heroically
repulsed.
</p>

<p>
The situation was rapidly becoming clearer.
Reinforcements were ordered to be sent up to all units
which had succeeded in reaching their objectives.
Bombing parties were to converge against the
German parties in the trench, and every effort was
made to improve and consolidate the positions won.
</p>

<p>
A determined attempt was made by the 5th
Canadian Mounted Rifles in Regina to join up with the
24th on their right.  One company of the 1st
Canadian Mounted Rifles was placed at the disposal of
the O.C. 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles for the
purpose, and two platoons, with the 5th Canadian
Mounted Rifles' bombers in front, pushed eastward
along the trench to the point at which they expected
to get into touch with the 24th.  The trench they
traversed was found to be exceptionally strong,
seven feet deep, with twelve-foot dug-outs every
second bay.  It had not been damaged by artillery.
On reaching their objective they perceived a large
body of men ahead of them, which they naturally
assumed to be the expected 24th Battalion party.
Unfortunately, this was not the case; it was, in fact,
a German counter-attack advancing in force.  These
Germans attacked and drove them back, foot by
foot, to their starting point.  A second attack was
then organised, which again succeeded in
penetrating to the objective point.  This point, with the
intervening stretch of trench, was stubbornly held
throughout the night until 5 a.m. on the 2nd, when
heavy counter-attacks pushed in both flanks and
compelled the evacuation of the trench.  Even then
the forty or so survivors clung to a line of
shell-holes south of the trench for some time before being
forced to retire to Hessian Trench.  From this time
the 8th Brigade held the original line until it was
handed over to the 7th Brigade on the night of
October 2nd-3rd.
</p>

<p>
On the right the dawn of October 2nd revealed
the situation to be approximately as follows.  The
20th Battalion, with the flanks secured, was
established, as has been described, about 150 yards
N.N.W. of where they were supposed to be with
the 18th Battalion consolidating on their left slightly
to the rear.  The British on the right (70th Brigade,
2nd Division, III Corps) had reached the southern
position of the Le Sars line on the previous evening
and were apprehensive as to their left flank.  Patrols
were sent out by both British and Canadians in an
endeavour to establish contact; yet although they
came into touch during the evening of the 1st, it
was not until the evening of the 2nd that proper
contact was effected and connecting posts planned.
</p>

<p>
The left flank of the 18th Battalion, left in the
air owing to the failure of the 22nd to come up,
was secured by the Battalion Lewis guns.
</p>

<p>
The parties of the 24th and 25th Battalions of
the 5th Brigade[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] which had fought so strenuously in
Regina were unable to maintain themselves in the
trench as long as did the 5th Canadian Mounted
Rifles on their left, but were driven out during the
night.
</p>

<p>
The 6th Brigade, waiting to relieve the 5th, was
finally ordered?  in the very early hours of October
2nd, to take over the line as it stood&mdash;that is, the
captured portion of Kenora Trench, the post in
Courcelette Trench, and the new trenches to the
west of Kenora.
</p>

<p>
This Brigade also took over the 4th Brigade
line as far east as the Pys Road.
</p>

<p>
There were no fresh developments during the
day.  Every nerve was concentrated on strengthening
and consolidating the positions won.  The 20th
Battalion had already a shallow trench dug across
their whole front.  The 18th likewise were
consolidating their position.  In the centre the 6th
Brigade, similarly engaged, had a rather quiet day,
and on the left the 8th Brigade, terribly depleted,
was holding its original line in the Hessian Trench.
</p>

<p>
The Battalions of the 4th and 8th Brigades which
had borne the brunt of the offensive were relieved
as soon as possible&mdash;the 8th by the 7th on the night
of October 2nd-3rd, and the 4th and 6th on the
night of the 3rd by the 9th Brigade.  The fresh
Brigades were warned to prepare for a renewed
offensive.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the wretched weather which now set
in, there was no diminution in the active preparations
for renewing the attack or in the ardour of the
troops.  Jumping-off trenches were constructed and
orders were expected from day to day.  Postponements,
however, were inevitable.  More time was
required for adequate artillery preparation.  Wire had
to be cut and ammunition to be accumulated in the
forward positions, which were now at a distance from
any practicable roads.  The attack eventually took
place on October 8th.
</p>

<p>
In the interval the most noteworthy incident was
the occupation of Kendal Trench on October 4th
by the Royal Canadian Regiment, who succeeded in
establishing a post within 25 yards of the enemy.
One-third of this trench&mdash;nearest our lines&mdash;was
found to be practically obliterated.
</p>

<p>
On October 8th the offensive on a large scale was
resumed.  In conjunction with the 23rd and 25th
British Divisions, on the right and left respectively,
the Canadian Corps attacked on a two-division
frontage, the 1st Division being on the right and the
3rd on the left.  Each Division had two Brigades in
the line.  The Battalions engaged, from right to
left, were the 4th and 3rd of the 1st Brigade, the
16th and 13th of the 3rd Brigade, the 58th and 43rd
of the 9th Brigade, and the Royal Canadian Rifles
and 49th of the 7th Brigade.
</p>

<p>
The objective of the 1st Division was to depend
upon the degree of success attending the preliminary
operation undertaken on the 7th by the 23rd Division.
If this Division attained its second objective&mdash;i.e.,
the remainder of Le Sars Village with its
left on the Chalk Pit&mdash;the 1st Division would
attempt the whole objective assigned to it.  In the
event of partial failure on the part of the 23rd
Division, the 1st Division would not attempt to carry
the quadrilateral.  The 23rd, however, were
completely successful, and accordingly the objective of
the 1st Division became as outlined below.
</p>

<p>
The 1st Brigade, on the right, was to capture and
hold a line running approximately north-west from
a point in Below Support Trench just west of the
Dyke Road to the junction with Gallwitz Support
Trench, thence south-west to the junction of Regina
and Farmer's Road.  At this point the objective
of the 3rd Brigade began.  It followed Regina
Trench west as far as the point M.13.b.6.1 (see
map).
</p>

<p>
To the left of this lay the portion of the objective
allotted to the 9th and 7th Brigades of the 3rd
Division.  Of this the 9th Brigade was to attack and
occupy the line of Regina from M.13.b.6.1 west to
the junction with Pys Road, north-west to the
German cross-trench between Courcelette Trench and
West Miraumont Road, and then due west along
this trench to, but not including, West Miraumont
Road itself.
</p>

<p>
The 7th Brigade was to form a defensive flank
from the junction of Twenty-three Road to West
Miraumont Road down the latter to Regina Trench
along the trench to the junction with the communication
trench (see map), at which point the flank was
turned back to Hessian Trench.
</p>

<p>
In the event of success the 7th Brigade was to
push out from West Miraumont Road and establish
a flank along Twenty-three Road after dark.
</p>

<p>
At 4.50 a.m. the long line of attack moved
forward.  The 4th Battalion, on the right, was held up
by wire in front of the first Below Trench.
Compelled to work round to the left, thereby rather
crowding the 3rd Battalion, they entered the first,
Below Trench just south of the quadrilateral and
proceeded to bomb south of Dyke Road.  Connection
was established with the 23rd Division on the
right and with the 3rd Battalion on the left.  Owing
to the greater resistance which the 4th Battalion
encountered at first, their supply of bombs
became exhausted in spite of gallant attempts to
replenish it.  In consequence, they were compelled to
borrow some from the 3rd Battalion, which had had
less resistance to overcome.  This generosity on the
part of the 3rd Battalion cost them dearly later on.
Having also lent bombs to the 16th Battalion on
their left, they found themselves, when heavily
counter-attacked about 2.15 p.m., hopelessly short
of munitions.  The enemy attacked in great force
and with great determination.  They poured down
the first and second Below and the first and second
Gallwitz Trenches, rushed the three posts which
had been established in the captured trenches, and
drove a wedge through the quadrilateral, even
coming over the open from the second Below Trench.
</p>

<p>
The situation of the 3rd and 4th Battalions was
now extremely precarious.  Attacked by a superior
force and without an adequate supply of bombs, they
fought tooth and nail to maintain their foothold.
The S.O.S. signals failed.  A wedge was driven
between the two Battalions.  The 3rd was bombed
down Regina Trench with a few of the 4th, while
the 4th was bombed down the first Below Trench.
</p>

<p>
On account of the congestion in Regina Trench
which naturally resulted, a number of men of the
3rd Battalion occupied shell-holes in front of the
trench, doing considerable execution with their
rifles.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Chatterton behaved with the greatest
gallantry.  He got some of his men out on the north
side of Regina Trench and attempted a bayonet
charge.  His charge was repulsed, and he himself
was shot through the shoulder.  Crawling back into
the trench and tying up his arm in a sling, he rallied
some men and got out on the south side of the
trench.  Another bayonet charge was attempted, in
which the intrepid Lieutenant was killed.  Major
Haddon, Major Mowat, and Major Bennett led a
similar charge, Major Mowat being killed.  All
attempts to stem the onrushing tide were unavailing.
In the end about 100 men got back to the original
line.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the 4th Battalion was being bombed
down the first Below Trench.  For hours a desperate
conflict raged in the trench.  Whenever the 4th
Battalion was able to borrow bombs from the 23rd
Division on their right, they gained ground;
whenever the supply of bombs ran low they were forced
to give way.  This give-and-take combat lasted until
about 6 p.m., when the survivors, about 120 in
number, dropped over into the Dyke Road in the
23rd Division lines.
</p>

<p>
The attack of the 3rd Brigade, on the left of the
1st, developed along very similar lines.  Early
reports were to the effect that the objectives had been
gained by the 16th and 13th Battalions.  "Everything
looks very well" and "Situation well in
hand," were the reports sent up to the Brigade.
Soon, however, a more unfortunate state of affairs
was revealed.  The 16th Battalion, it appeared, had
indeed reached its objective, but the left flank had
been bombed cut.  The remainder, on the right,
fought for a long time with great stubbornness and
tenacity.  Lieutenant Hall sent in a message about
7.30 a.m. to say that, so far as he was aware, he was
me only unwounded officer left.
</p>

<p>
The German counter-attack in the early afternoon
which drove back the 3rd and 4th Battalions
dashed itself in vain against the right flank of the
16th.  The position of the Battalion was,
nevertheless, far from secure.  On the left the 13th
Battalion had encountered heavy wire in front of the
German trench.  A few men of the Battalion
apparently managed to get in with the 16th.  The
attack against a position strongly held and
protected by impassable wire was necessarily doomed
to failure, and a message from Major McCuaig,
about 8 a.m., stated that the 13th had been compelled
to retire.  Their casualties were very heavy.  They
lay on the far side of the crest, in full view of the
enemy, whose snipers cut off communication.
</p>

<p>
The left flank of the 16th was thus left in the
air throughout the day.  Their right flank was left
exposed when the 1st Brigade was driven back in
the afternoon.  In this precarious situation they
held on grimly, even though, owing to the exposed
nature of the ground, snipers and machine-guns
made it practically impossible to get a supply of
bombs up, until, late in the evening, all possibility
of success elsewhere having ceased to exist, they
were ordered to abandon the position they had so
stoutly held and to retire to their jumping-off
trenches.  The situation had to be accepted as it
stood; the battalions were consolidated, removed as
soon as possible in favour of the supporting
battalions, and the line generally linked up and
strengthened.
</p>

<p>
The ill-luck which had attended the assault of
the two Brigades of the 1st Division also dogged
the gallant efforts of the 9th and 7th Brigades of
the 3rd Division.
</p>

<p>
During the few days' preliminary bombardment
of the front-line wire, careful reconnaissances of the
wire were made.  Reports received just prior to the
attack indicated that the wire in front of the
objective had been well cut for the most part, and both
Brigades expressed confidence on this point.  But,
as in the operations of October 1st, it was
discovered later that a considerable amount of wire
remained.
</p>

<p>
This fact materially affected the success of the
operations.  Yet the reports were not, on the whole,
inaccurate, as on the night before the attack the
Germans threw out large quantities of loose wire,
which formed an awkward obstacle, and a second
line of staked wire was encountered immediately in
front of the trench at various points.  Direct
observation of this wire, particularly between
Twenty-three Road and the junction of Regina and Kenora
Trenches, had been particularly difficult and uncertain.
</p>

<p>
In spite of adverse weather conditions, jumping-off
trenches were prepared along a large portion of
the divisional front, and at 4.50 a.m., zero hour, the
two Brigades advanced to the assault.  A heavy
rain, which commenced shortly afterwards and
continued throughout the greater part of the day,
contributed largely to the difficulties of the situation.
</p>

<p>
At zero hour the 9th and 7th Brigades moved
forward with the rest of the long line of attack.
From early reports, received from wounded men, it
seemed that both Brigades had obtained their
objectives.  Unduly optimistic reports of this sort
are easily explained.  A wounded man sees his
comrades advancing steadily within striking distance of
the objective, and in perfect good-faith reports that
apparently his unit has attained its objective.
Appearances, however, were never more deceptive than
in the present instance.
</p>

<p>
For some time after the attack began no definite
news could be obtained about the 9th (right) Brigade.
At 8.50 a.m. they reported that their left Battalion
(the 43rd) had been held up by wire, and that only
a portion of the right Battalion (the 58th) had
effected a lodgment in Regina, from which they
were later driven out.  The left company and left
half of the centre company of the 58th suffered
severely before they reached Regina Trench.  At
the trench itself all three companies encountered
heavy wire.  The wire had been very little damaged
by our artillery, and presented a formidable
obstacle.  Heavy machine-gun fire was brought
to play upon the three companies in front of the wire.
</p>

<p>
The greater part of the right company were able
to force an entry through a small sally port.
Having gained a foothold in the trench, our men
worked along to the right and held for about thirty
minutes some 100 yards of the trench, up to a strong
bombing post situated approximately on the right
flank of the Battalion's objective.
</p>

<p>
The left portion of this company meanwhile
entered Regina through another sally port, made
their way as far as a communication trench on the
left, and on the right established contact with the
remainder of the company on the right.
</p>

<p>
All this time the centre and left companies were
striving, heroically but unsuccessfully, to penetrate
the wire.  This left the right half of the Battalion,
in Regina Trench, most precariously situated.  Both
flanks were in the air; on the right of the 58th the
left Battalion (the 13th) of the 1st Division had
been repulsed, and on the left the left section of
the Battalion had failed.  The Germans, taking
immediate advantage of the opportunity, attacked
right and left from the bombing post and
communication trench already mentioned.  After a
fierce struggle the survivors of the 58th were
expelled, and made their way, as best they could, back
to their lines.
</p>

<p>
The 43rd Battalion, on the left of the 8th Brigade,
also managed to establish themselves for a time in
Regina Trench.  Uncut wire effectually stopped the
right and centre companies, even though a few
individuals here and there succeeded in getting into
the trench, never to return.  But the left company,
like the right of the 58th, got in.  Some of them
lost direction, and entered Regina with elements
of the Royal Canadian Regiment on the western side
of West Miraumont Road.
</p>

<p>
A counter-attack in overwhelming force followed
almost immediately, and only about ten men of this
company returned to our lines.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, on the left the 7th Brigade had also
effected a lodgment in Regina.  On the Brigade's
right the Royal Canadian Regiment occupied Regina
for a distance of 100 yards west of the West
Miraumont Road.  The enemy were still between them
and the 49th on the left.
</p>

<p>
The 49th had also succeeded, according to
reports, in pushing through to their objective.  Two
companies were reported to be at the junction of
Kenora and Regina Trenches with some men of the
Royal Canadian Regiment.  They were bombing
eastward in an endeavour to connect with the latter
battalion.  This was the situation at 7 a.m.  As it
appeared altogether likely that complete success
would result if supports were brought up and the
attack pushed resolutely home, the Princess
Patricias, in support, were moved close up (two
companies in the jumping-off trench and two in the
Fabeck Graben), ready to advance whenever called
upon.
</p>

<p>
On the Brigade right the Royal Canadian Regiment
attempted to reinforce their troops in Regina
by moving a company up the West Miramont
Road.  Heavy machine-gun fire foiled this
attempt.
</p>

<p>
More definite information regarding the situation
now began to come in.  It was ascertained that the
right and centre companies of the R.C.R. had
entered the trench without serious casualties, but
that the left company had been hung up by heavy
machine-gun fire.  The two companies which had
entered Regina proceeded to mop up the numerous
dug-outs in this portion of Regina and pushed out
a strong patrol along the West Miraumont Road.
A bombing party also bombed their way westward
along Regina in an attempt to gain touch with the
49th, who were reported to have effected a lodgment
to their left.
</p>

<p>
This report, however, was unduly optimistic.  The
right company of the 49th, bearing a trifle too far
to the right, eventually reached Kenora Trench and
occupied it under heavy fire.  The centre and left
companies, advancing straight on their objectives,
passed through a row of well-cut wire, only to find
further progress blocked by the presence of an
unsuspected new row of wire, entirely undamaged.
With dogged resolution they made their way along
the front of the wire, seeking a gap.  None was
found, and after losing heavily they finally got into
Kenora Trench.  Animated by the most intense
determination to reach their objective at all costs,
they pushed three bombing parties up Kenora
Trench.  Every party met the same fate&mdash;wiped out
by the Germans concentrated at the junction of
Kenora and Regina Trenches.
</p>

<p>
The situation on the 3rd Divisional front at
9 a.m. was therefore as follows.  On the right the
58th Battalion of the 9th Brigade, had effected a
temporary lodgment from which they had shortly
afterwards been expelled.  The 43rd Battalion had
failed to get in on the left, the R.C.R. had got in
with two companies, but the 49th, on their left,
reported successful at first, had failed to obtain any
footing in the objective.
</p>

<p>
At this stage of the operations the Corps Commander
visited the 3rd Divisional Headquarters.
After studying the situation, he gave orders that
every effort should be made to secure the portion
of Regina Trench held by the 7th Brigade westward
from the West Miraumont Road, and that, if
necessary, supports and reserves were to be sent up to
ensure success.  With West Miraumont Road as the
right flank, efforts were to be made to gain as much
ground as possible, but not beyond Regina Trench.
If necessary, the 8th Brigade and the remainder of
the 9th Brigade would be used, as Regina Trench
had to be gained at all costs.  All available reserves
were pushed up.  The 60th, in support of the 9th
Brigade, moved up two sections of bombers.  The
43rd of this Brigade was ordered to assist the R.C.R. on
their left in maintaining their position in Regina.
The support Battalion of the 7th Brigade, the
Princess Patricias, also moved up as close as
possible.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, before a fresh offensive could be
launched, reports began to come in that the
R.C.R. had been unable to maintain their hold in Regina
Trench.  The men of the Princess Patricias sent up
to reinforce the R.C.R. met the gallant defenders of
the outpost returning to our trenches.  A strong
counter-attack had been too much for the weakened
and wearied garrison.  All returned together to
Kenora Trench.
</p>

<p>
Early in the afternoon it became evident that the
attack had failed all along the Corps' front.  The
line was consolidated during the night by the
wearied troops in the line, aided by the supports.
Little progress could be made on account of the
weakness of the garrisons.  On the left flank the
depleted R.C.R. and 49th were combined into a
composite Battalion.
</p>

<p>
On the following night the 8th Brigade relieved
the 7th and 9th Brigades.
</p>

<p>
The undeniable failure of the operations of
October 1st and 8th did not dishearten the
Canadians.  Rather did it merely increase their
determination to "get" Regina, whatever the cost.  It
was intolerable that such a series of checks should
follow the glorious triumph of Courcelette.
Nevertheless, it is not to be wondered at that we should
have met with these temporary checks, which were,
indeed, far from diminishing the prestige of the
Canadian Corps[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>] as a fighting force.  The victories
of the 15th and immediately following days had
had a double effect.  They had severely reduced the
numbers of the Canadian battalions while bringing
them into contact with positions yet more formidably
defended.  At the same time they had forced the
enemy to concentrate upon this sector, so
imminently menaced, great reinforcements of men and
guns.  Their task had doubled, while their means of
dealing with it had diminished.  The quality of an
army is sometimes manifested no less brilliantly in
reverse than in success; and the scant result of
these sanguinary struggles before Regina Trench in
no way lessened the confidence of the Higher
Command in the capacity of our troops.
</p>

<p>
A renewal of the offensive was daily expected, and
active preparations were made in anticipation of the
event.  Meanwhile, the arrival of the new 4th
Division during this period of waiting and recuperation
was hailed by the hardened campaigners of the three
older Divisions with feelings of liveliest satisfaction.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<h4>
REGINA (<i>continued</i>)
</h4>

<p>
The 4th Division, commanded by Major-General
David Watson, C.B., C.M.G., entered the Somme
area on October 10th and 11th, 1916, during the lull
between the operations of October 8th and those of
October 21st.
</p>

<p>
Though a new Division, which had never as yet
taken part in any concerted major operations, it
soon proved itself no whit inferior to the senior
Divisions.  It had had practical experience in
holding the line in the Ypres salient in September, and
it had already been blooded, for on the night of
September 16th it had carried out a well-planned
series of simultaneous raids which reflected the
greatest credit on the new Division.  There were
seven raiding parties.
</p>

<p>
The first party consisted of one officer and forty
men of the 22nd Battalion.  Leaving the trenches
at 11.22 p.m., the party moved cautiously forward,
great care being necessary owing to the bright
moonlight.  The scaling ladders and chicken wire were
left behind, as it was feared they might be seen too
easily.  As soon as the enemy trench was rushed the
party split into two, working to the right and left.
The enemy bolted so swiftly that only two were
caught.  Dug-outs were bombed and as much wire
as possible destroyed by the covering party.  At
12.25 a.m. the raiders left the enemy trench and
found their way back without difficulty by means of
the white tape laid for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
The 46th Battalion party of one officer and thirty-one
other ranks carried out the second raid against
the Hollandscheschuur Salient.  At 12.20 a.m. the
raiders crawled over the intervening space of forty
yards, rushed the trench, and worked down to a
supposed strong point.  This proved to be merely a
large hole, unstrengthened in any way.  Explosives
which had been brought to blow up this post were
used against an occupied dug-out, 62 lb. of guncotton
being touched off for the purpose.  Fifteen Germans
were killed during the raid and one captured.  No
difficulty was experienced in penetrating the wire.
</p>

<p>
The third raid was entrusted to the 47th Battalion.
The raiding party of one officer and twenty-eight
other ranks had further to go than the preceding
parties and started five minutes earlier.  Complete
success was attained.  The party bombed south after
entering the enemy trench, making for a supposed
strong point which turned out to be similar to the
one above.  Nine Germans were killed and ten
taken prisoners.
</p>

<p>
The fourth raid was also undertaken by the 47th
Battalion.  A comparatively long distance separated
the two trench lines, some 200 yards.  On this
account an early start was imperative.  Scarcely any
resistance was encountered.  Six Germans were
killed, and others were pursued but not caught.  The
artillery preparation, under Lieutenant-Colonel
McNaughton, and the trench-mortar work were all
that could be desired.
</p>

<p>
The 75th Battalion carried out the fifth raid.
Three officers and thirty-one other ranks constituted
the raiding party.  They moved out just after
midnight, formed up outside our wire, and were within
twenty yards of the German trench while it was still
being bombarded.  Rushing in as soon as the barrage
lifted, they divided up into two parties, which
bombed right and left for fifty yards.  Some resistance
was encountered by the right party, but five
of the enemy were killed, three captured, and the
rest escaped over the parados under fire from the
covering party.  The left party also experienced
resistance, but reached their objective in spite of
opposition.  Dug-outs were bombed and the enemy
forced to escape over the parados.  After a
successful withdrawal the artillery was again turned on to
the front line.  Of the six prisoners taken four
bolted on the way back and came to an untimely
end.  The 7th Belgian Field Artillery supporting
the raid, rendered excellent service, which earned
the warm commendation of all concerned in the
operation.
</p>

<p>
The sixth raid, by the 54th Battalion was the
most elaborate of all.  Four officers and fifty-eight
other ranks took part.  The objective was No. 2
Crater at St. Eloi.  Almost at the start the officers
in charge were wounded.  An unavoidable loss of
direction and control naturally resulted, though the
parties succeeded in reaching their objectives.  An
unfortunate <i>contretemps</i> arose from the fact that the
bugler who was to have sounded the signal to retire
fell into an exceedingly muddy and unsavoury
shell-hole and lost his bugle!  "A" party, on the left,
captured three prisoners and bombed several
inhabited dug-outs.  A machine-gun was also
captured.  "B," "C," and "D" parties met with little
resistance, and saw nothing of the enemy.  "E"
party bombed northwards towards No. 3 Crater, met
with little opposition and captured one prisoner.
"F" party had a harder task to the south on the far
side of No. 3 Crater, but captured three prisoners
and an automatic rifle, which was unfortunately lost
when the man carrying it was wounded.  "G" party,
also moving south, unsuccessfully chased a number
of the enemy towards the 75th raiding party.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the retirement began an undiscovered
machine-gun opened up unexpectedly.  Fifteen of
the enemy were killed, including an officer and two
men who resisted all attempts to bring them back
after capture.  Six prisoners were brought in.
</p>

<p>
The seventh raid, undertaken by the 87th Battalion,
was unsuccessful.  The three officers and forty-seven
other ranks who made up the party got well
away close under the barrage, but on reaching the
parapet two small mines were exploded beneath
them.  In some way the enemy had become aware of
the approaching raid, probably owing to an attack
carried out by the Division on the left; the element
of surprise, the great factor in all successful raids,
was thus lost.  Heavy fire was directed against the
attackers; and after a brisk exchange of bombs it
became evident that nothing could be accomplished.
The party accordingly withdrew.
</p>

<p>
These raids, with the one exception noted, were
eminently successful.  This success was due in no
small measure to the very careful preparation made
beforehand.  The parties involved were withdrawn
from the line a week before the raid, all details were
carefully worked out, trenches dug to scale, the
ground constantly patrolled, and the raiding parties
taken over it by night in small groups.  The excellent
artillery support and the thorough work of the
covering parties all contributed to the satisfactory
result.
</p>

<p>
On their arrival in the Somme area the 4th Division
was fortunate enough to experience a few days
of comparative quiet, with little more than shell-fire
and sniping to incommode them while getting
themselves shaken down into their new lines.  Owing
largely to the wretched weather, the conditions
underfoot, and the state of the trenches, the
operations pending, major and preliminary, were from day
to day postponed.  In fact, the three senior
Canadian Divisions were withdrawn from the area before
another attack in force was launched against the
blood-drenched barrier of Regina.  On October
17th the 4th Division, remaining behind, came under
the orders of the II Corps for the purpose of future
operations.  These operations, in so far as the 4th
Division was concerned, began on October 21st.
</p>

<p>
The general plan of operations was as follows.
The II Corps[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>] was to attack on the front between
Courcelette Trench and the River Ancre in order
to capture Petit Miraumont, Grandcourt, and at
Pierre Divion.  Afterwards the passages of the
Ancre were to be forced and the II Corps would
co-operate with the V Corps by pushing north.
There were three Divisions in line, the 18th, 19th,
and 39th, from right to left.  The dual <i>rôle</i> of the
4th Canadian Division was to protect the right flank
of the 18th Division of the II Corps and to
safeguard the left flank of the III Corps on the right.
</p>

<p>
A preliminary operation was assigned to the II
Corps before the general action began.  This
preparatory task was the capture of the Regina Stuff
line of trenches, to be undertaken by the 18th, 25th,
and 39th Divisions, from right to left.  In this
operation the 4th Canadian Division would
co-operate by effecting the capture of Regina Trench
from Courcelette Trench to a point just before the
intersection of the Pys Road, thence approximately
along an old German trench to join up with the
sapheads which were being built by the 10th Canadian
Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier-General William
Hughes, D.S.O.
</p>

<p>
The 11th Brigade, on the left, under Brigadier-General
V. W. Odlum, D.S.O., undertook the capture
of the portion of Regina Trench assigned to
the Division.  Meanwhile, the 10th Brigade was to
co-operate by pushing forward its saps so as to be
able to support the 11th Brigade by an enfilading
fire.  Each Brigade, by the 19th, had completed a
very useful sap, close to the junction of their
respective lines, up old German trenches to within
two-thirds of the distance to Regina.  The 11th Brigade
placed the 87th and 102nd Battalions in the line, the
former on the right, each Battalion having two
companies of the 75th in support.
</p>

<p>
At noon on the 21st the attack began.  The whole
operation was an unqualified success.  Before the
afternoon was far advanced the objectives had all
been gained and consolidated, blocks established in
Regina and up the Pys Road, and contact effected
with the equally successful 53rd Brigade of the 18th
Division on the left.  The co-operation of the 10th
Brigade on the right was all that could be desired.
Altogether the result of the action was a welcome
change from the disappointments attending the
hard-fought and determined attempts against Regina
earlier in the month.  The new and comparatively
raw Division had won its spurs with <i>éclat</i>.
</p>

<p>
On the 25th of the month a second preliminary
operation was undertaken.  In preparation for this
attack the right of the 10th Brigade was extended to
the Chalk Pit.
</p>

<p>
At 7 a.m. the attacking Battalion, the 44th,
advanced to the assault, supported by the 46th.  Early
reports seemed to indicate that the operation had
been entirely successful.  It soon became evident,
however, that this was not the case.  The enemy was
enabled to hold his trenches in great force and to
bring a devastatingly effective enfilading machine-gun
fire to bear upon the 44th from the vicinity of the
quadrangle.  There was nothing for it but to take
such cover as was available&mdash;old disused trenches
and shell-holes, where many remained until dark.
The Battalion suffered very heavily, having 3 officers
killed and 7 wounded, and of other ranks 29 killed,
152 wounded, and 23 missing.  The work of the
stretcher-bearers in this action was especially
commendable.
</p>

<p>
A long period of very bad weather compelled
the postponement of further operation from day to
day.  Numerous operation orders and amending
orders were issued, but nothing could be attempted
until better weather conditions prevailed.  It was
decided that an attack on the remaining right section
of Regina Trench would be made as soon as the
weather should allow of two days' successful
bombardment.  On November 9th and 10th fine weather
permitted good shooting.  The plan of attack had
been ready for some time in anticipation, and
accordingly an assault was determined for the night of
November 10th-11th.
</p>

<p>
From right to left the attacking line consisted of
the 46th and 47th Battalions of the 10th Brigade
and the 102nd Battalion of the 11th Brigade,
attached for the purpose to the 10th Brigade.  The
aim was to capture and consolidate Regina Trench
from the block established in Regina on the right
flank of the 11th Brigade attack of October 21st to
Farmer's Road.  The 46th Battalion, on the right,
attacked the line from the right boundary of the
objective to the intersection of the Practice Road.
The 47th Battalion was responsible for the central
section.  The 102nd Battalion, on the left,
advanced against the remaining portion of Regina and
also from the right extremity of the part of Regina
already held in a north-easterly direction against the
new enemy line running north and north-west from
Regina to the Pys Road.
</p>

<p>
The 46th and 47th Battalions attacked at zero
hour, midnight, with two companies each in line, in
four waves.  The company of the 102nd which
advanced against Regina went forward in two waves,
as did also the three platoons which attacked from
Regina north-easterly towards the new German line.
</p>

<p>
The operation as a whole was very successful.
The enemy's barrage was over the heads of the
attacking troops, who stole a march on their
opponents, for zero hour found them 150 yards in advance
of their front trench, so that they were in amongst
the Germans almost before the Huns realised what
was happening.  In the centre success was
immediate and complete, though the 47th suffered more
severely than the other Battalions for the reason
that they were the only Battalion to run into heavy
machine-gun fire.  On the right the 46th was equally
victorious, but they encountered a stiffer resistance.
Good fortune also favoured the attack of the 102nd
Battalion on the left.  The specified portion of
Regina was captured, and the northern attacking
party was also, at first, completely successful; later,
however, they were bombed back some distance, and
established a block about 85 yards in advance of
Regina.  This post was stoutly held against a
number of determined counter-attacks.
</p>

<p>
By 1.20 a.m. the 46th and 47th had overrun their
objective, and dug in some 100 yards beyond it.
Unfortunately, this new line came under our own
protective artillery fire, and had to be abandoned.
By 2.20 a.m., however, consolidation was well
advanced.  The required posts were established, and
work started on new connecting saps and trenches.
The working party which the O.C. 46th had been
ordered to detail came up on time, and everything
was rapidly rounding into shape, including the new
connecting trench between Regina and Kling
Trenches.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak a concentration by the enemy in
Below and New Gallwitz Trenches was dispersed
by our artillery.  Conditions rapidly became normal,
and it was now possible to take stock of the position.
Altogether it had been a notable success for the
4th Division.
</p>

<p>
The casualties in the 10th Brigade were 3 officers
killed and 4 wounded, and 41 other ranks killed,
156 wounded, and 26 missing.  The majority of
these were of the 47th Battalion.
</p>

<p>
The 102nd Battalion of the 11th Brigade had
4 officers wounded, 10 other ranks killed, 34
wounded, and 8 missing.
</p>

<p>
Three officers and 84 other ranks were captured,
also 4 machine-guns.  About 50 German dead were
found in the trench; and, in addition, they lost a
number of men who endeavoured to escape across
country.
</p>

<p>
Regina Trench itself proved a disappointment.
It was knee-deep in mud, and some of the dug-outs
had only been commenced.  In addition to the
capture of Regina, the advanced salient shown on the
map was pushed out in order to secure observation
of Coulée and Below Trenches.
</p>

<p>
All concerned in the operation received the
congratulations of the Higher Command.  The whole
of Regina Trench, which had defied the Canadian
Corps for over a month, was now in British hands;
and the 4th Canadian Division had earned an
enviable reputation for a young Division&mdash;-a reputation
which was to be further enhanced by the achievement
of the 11th Brigade a week later.
</p>

<p>
On November 18th this Brigade, taking part in
the resumed general offensive, carried out its task
of capturing and consolidating Desire Trench.  The
whole operation, which is described in the succeeding
chapter, was executed with dash and thoroughness,
and brought to a fitting conclusion the
strenuous campaign of the Canadian Divisions on
the Somme.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<h4>
DESIRE TRENCH
</h4>

<p>
Throughout the closing operations against
Regina Trench our Battalions had been forced to
pluck every hard success from the teeth of a new
foe who had come suddenly to the support of the
German defence.  This foe was the mud, the hated
Somme mud, deep, slithering, tenacious as glue,
foul with all the filth left behind by the enemy as
he gave back yard by yard.  For the weather had
turned against us.  The rains of the rainiest autumn
which had scourged their high plateaus for many a
year were a timely reinforcement to the hard-pressed
enemy.  When it came to the attack upon Desire
Trench, on November 17th-18th, the disastrous
alliance of mud and rain-drench had reached such
a pitch of obstruction that the capture of this line
was reluctantly recognised as marking the limit of
our possible advance, for the time, upon this sector.
The light railways, spread over the vast, red,
undulating expanses of naked mud, between the
engulfing and omnipresent pits of slime, were being
constantly scattered and put out of service by
the German shells from north and east&mdash;from
beyond the Ancre and from the hidden batteries
in Lupart Wood; and they were utterly
incapable of keeping up the ammunition supply
for our valiant advanced batteries of 18-pounders.
Our heavies, the great 9.2 howitzers lurking in
and around the tossed ruins of Pozières and
behind Courcelette, were well supplied, thanks
to the indefatigable labours of the road-making
companies along the great and crowded artery of the
Bapaume Road.  But the 18-pounders, in their
shallow gun-pits far out across the shell-swept
stretches of the mud, had to be fed by pack-mules,
carrying shells in panniers slung across the back.
Such a method of transport was torturingly slow,
and perilous to the last degree, but it was the
only one capable of coping with the situation.
Under the numbing strain the spirit and humour of
our men remained irrepressible, as instanced in
the following retort to a sentry's challenge.  Under
the chill downpour of the unrelenting rain, through
the blind night, a soldier, just returned from four
days' duty in the front trenches, came stumbling in
along the Bapaume Road toward the billets of
Albert.  Shrapnel helmet, overcoat, pack, everything
but his precious rifle, was covered thick with that
chalky mud which sticketh closer than a brother,
and he waded heavily through the mire of the
tormented roadway.  He reached a dripping sentry.
"Halt!  Who goes there?" came the challenge, as
the labouring figure lurched up in the gloom.
"Submarine U13," grunted the traveller.  "Pass,
Submarine U13," responded the sentry cheerfully; and
the moving shape of mud rolled on toward the
shattered billets brooded over by the falling Virgin
and Child.
</p>

<p>
Under such conditions, but in such unshakable
temper, the men of the 4th Canadian Division moved
to the taking of the position known as Desire Support
Trench, on which for days they had been casting
covetous eyes.  Our objective lay across our whole
Divisional front, from about Farmer's Road on the
right to some 600 yards west of the West Miraumont
Road on the left.  At this point our left flank made
connection with the 18th Division, which was to
attack, simultaneously with our advance, the western
sector of Desire Trench, and other trenches which
were protecting the approaches to Grandcourt
Village.  The right of our attack&mdash;a frontage of only
five or six hundred yards, but one offering extreme
difficulties&mdash;was confided to the 10th Brigade, under
Brigadier-General W. St. P. Hughes.  The left, and
main, sector, beginning at the Pys Road, was
committed to the 11th Brigade, under Brigadier-General
V. W. Odlum, who had two Battalions from the
12th Brigade, the 38th and the 78th, attached to his
command.  There were thus three Battalions
engaged upon the right sector, and five upon the left.
The 10th Brigade, with its restricted frontage and
limited objective, attacked with two companies of
the 50th Battalion (Calgary Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel
E. G. Mason) and one company and one
platoon of the 46th (South Saskatchewan Regiment,
Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Dawson) in the assaulting
waves, with one company of the 44th (Winnipeg,
Lieutenant-Colonel E. K. Wayland) in support.
General Odlum made his attack with four Battalions,
each represented by two companies in the assaulting
wave, and one Battalion, behind his centre, in
support.  The attacking Battalions, from right to left,
were as follows:&mdash;The 75th (Mississaugas
Battalion, of Toronto, Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Beckett),
54th (Kootenay Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel
A. G. H. Kemball), 87th (Canadian Grenadier
Guards, Montreal, Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. Frost),
and 38th of the 12th Brigade (Ottawa,
Lieutenant-Colonel C. M. Edwards); while the Battalion
supporting was the 78th (Manitoba, Lieutenant-Colonel
J. Kirkcaldie), also of the 12th Brigade.  The
artillery supporting the operation consisted of the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisional Artillery (commanded
respectively by Brigadier-General H. C. Thacker,
C.M.G., Brigadier-General E. W. B. Morrison,
and Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Mitchell),
the Yukon Motor Machine-Gun Battery (Captain
H. F. Murling), and also by the 11th Divisional
Artillery and the 2nd Corps Heavy Artillery.
</p>

<p>
The barrage work of the artillery was admirably
co-ordinated, and effectually cleared the way for that
success which so abundantly rewarded the operation
as a whole in spite of failure on the extreme
right.  While a concentrated standing barrage was
flaming and crashing along the whole line of the
enemy trench, at the hour for launching the attack
(6.10 a.m.) a creeping barrage was put up along a line
200 yards in front of our own parapets.  This line
of roaring death rolled onward at the rate of 50 yards
per minute, with the first wave of our assault
following close behind it&mdash;so close, in their eagerness,
that a sergeant swore he might have lighted his pipe
at it.  Presently this barrage merged into the
standing barrage along the German trench.  At fourteen
minutes after the launching of the attack the
combined barrage lifted from the doomed trench and
rolled inexorably onward for another 250 yards,
where it rested as a barrier against counter-attacks.
The trench was seized, all opposition being swiftly
overwhelmed, and our men rushed on behind the
barrage to a distance of 150 yards beyond the
captured line.  Here they hurriedly dug themselves in,
knowing that the Germans would begin to shell
Desire itself as soon as it should be reported that
we had captured it.  In order that the enemy might
not discover our ruse in time to thwart it, a dense
smoke-screen was flung out by a special company
of the Royal Engineers in front of the line where
our men were furiously digging.  The positions
thus gained, about 150 yards beyond Desire, were
consolidated and held; and they stood to mark the
limit of Canada's advance on the Somme.
</p>

<p>
So much, in brief, for the battle of Desire Trench.
Viewed as a whole, it was a rounded and clean-cut
success, and earned warm commendation for General
Watson and his hard-fighting 4th Division.  To
get an idea of the fluctuations of the struggle, it
is necessary to take the operations of the 10th and
11th Brigades separately.
</p>

<p>
The task assigned to the 10th Brigade, as already
stated, was an attack on a very narrow but extremely
exposed and strongly defended objective.  The
whole line of this objective lay open to concentrated
artillery fire from the enemy's rear, and was
murderously cross-raked by the fire from a number
of machine-gun nests.  It proved, in the event,
difficult to carry and impossible to hold.  But this
comparative failure, happily, did not vitiate the
success of the main operation, which lay along the
left front.
</p>

<p>
The 50th Battalion, occupying the Brigade left,
made its advance successfully to a depth of some
300 yards, and gained its objective with small loss.
This objective was a line running east from the
Pys Road.  Here, however, it got involved in our
own smoke barrage, lost its direction (and consequently
its touch with the troops on its left), swerved
to the right, and left an open gap of about 200
yards between the two Brigades.  Then the
German guns from Lupart Wood in front opened an
annihilating fire upon it, machine-guns swept it from
both sides, and it was forced back with a loss of
12 officers and 200 other ranks&mdash;over half its total
strength in the attack.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the 46th Battalion, on the right, was
faring no better.  The attack was made by one
company and one platoon, in two waves, on a front
of 100 yards.  There was a distance of 40 yards
between the waves.  The first wave, keeping a fair
line in spite of the shell-holes, escaped the German
barrage, and got to within 70 yards of the enemy's
parapets with small loss.  Here, however, it was
met by massed rifle fire full in the face&mdash;for our
own barrage at this point was playing behind instead
of upon the German trench, and the trench was
occupied in full force.  At the same time a torrent
of machine-gun fire opened up on the left.  The
wave was broken.  The survivors took refuge in
shell-holes, where they had to lie all day under a
ceaseless storm of shell and bullets, till darkness
enabled them to crawl back to our lines.  The
second wave fared even worse.  It was caught by
the enemy's barrage as it was coming over the
parapet.  Torn and diminished, it nevertheless
rushed on, in the face of intolerable punishment,
till it was a line no longer.  Its remnants made their
way into a sap and crept back into Regina.  Later
in the day, however, the Brigade was able to thrust
forward again for a short distance on the left,
toward the Pys Road, and so to contain the position
which it had failed to capture.  Thus contained
the position ceased to be of service to the enemy
or any serious menace to our new line on the left;
and day or two afterwards it was simply pounded
out of existence by a "combined shoot" of all our
heavy guns.
</p>

<p>
In the main attack, all along the line westward
from Pys Road, things went well from the start.
By 7.30 reports came back from the 75th, 54th, and
38th Battalions that all were in their objectives and
busy consolidating their gains.  The only mystery
was in regard to the 87th, which though apparently
successful, had disappeared.  While this matter was
in doubt the Germans launched a counter-attack
from Coulée Trench against the 54th Battalion.
They advanced with a great show of resolution
several hundred yards, then suddenly, to our
astonishment, flung down their bombs and rifles,
threw up their hands, and rushed into our line as
eager prisoners.  About 8.50 came news that the
38th Battalion, not content with having captured its
objective, had pushed on and gained a section of
Grandcourt Trench, where it was establishing itself
successfully.  Then about 9 o'clock the mystery of
the 87th was solved.  This Battalion also, feeling
that it had not had enough had gone on to try
conclusions with Grandcourt Trench, and made good
its footing there.
</p>

<p>
These fine adventures of the 38th and 87th,
however, were doomed to prove fruitless of result.  The
operation of the Canadians against Desire Trench
was, as we have seen, part of a wider movement,
extending far to the left, before Grandcourt Village.
The 18th Division, on our immediate left, though
worn with long fighting and far below strength, had
made good upon its right, where it joined our lines,
but had been held up by insurmountable obstacles
near Grandcourt.  For this reason the Higher
Command decided that it would be inadvisable to
attempt to hold such an advanced position as the 38th
and 87th had taken in Grandcourt Trench.  In the
course of the day, therefore, came orders that all
advanced units were to come back to their original
first objectives and consolidate there.  The line of
Desire Trench, thus gained and secured, was an
admirable one, strong for defence, and advantageous
to attack from when next the occasion should offer
itself.  And on this line the 4th Division rested
until, at the end of the month, they were relieved
and moved back to Doullens.  The casualties of
the Division in this fine action amounted to 75
officers and 1,276 other ranks.  The prisoners taken
numbered 625, of whom 17 were officers.  The
Division received warm congratulations from the
Commanders of the Corps and the Army upon the
success of this its concluding operation in the
blood-drenched battlefields of the Somme.
</p>

<p>
From these fields the Canadian Forces, the four
Divisions henceforth united into an Army Corps in
all respects complete within itself, were removed to
the north of Arras, to take into their competent
keeping that vital area lying under the menace of
Vimy Ridge and the impregnable outposts of Lens.
</p>

<p>
Welded now by sacrifice, endurance, prudent and
brilliant leaderships, and glorious achievements
against the mightiest military Power in the world's
history, into a fighting force of incomparable
effectiveness, it was no less than their due that the most
tremendous tasks should be set to these fiery and
indomitable fighters of the North.  To the Canadian
Battalions the impregnable and the invincible had
come to mean a challenge which they welcomed
joyously.  They knew that the utmost of which men
were capable was now confidently expected of them.
How gloriously they were to justify that high
expectation, on the dreadful Ridge of Vimy, amid the
bloody slag-heaps of Lens, and along the fire-swept
crest of Passchendaele, remains to be told
succeeding volumes of their story.

</p>

<p>
At 12.35 p.m. the 1st and 2nd Divisions attack and,
after heavy fighting, partially occupy the Zollern,
Hessian, and Kenora Trenches.  On the right the 29th and
31st Battalions are held up in their operations north of
Courcelette, but after several determined attacks succeed
in gaining their objective.  The enemy resist stubbornly,
and during the night bombard Courcelette and the whole
front line.  The left of the 2nd Brigade is badly hampered
in its operations by machine-gun fire from Mouquet Farm
and Stuff Redoubt.  Representations made to the 11th

official clearing up to the Farm.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>September 27th.</i>
</p>

<p>
In the morning the 2nd Brigade attacked the Hessian
Trench and drove the Germans back towards Regina
Trench, only to lose the greater part of their gain in a
strong hostile counter-attack about 1 p.m.  A fresh
attack was made in the afternoon and the whole regained
and held.  At 6.30 p.m. it was reported that the Germans
had withdrawn from their line between the Bapaume Road

</p>

<p>
EXTRACT FROM RESERVE ARMY S.G. 66/8. 30/9/16.&mdash;"The
operations of the Reserve Army will comprise two
simultaneous attacks.
</p>

<p>
"(<i>a</i>) A southern attack by the Canadian Corps to capture
Irles.  The right of this attack will rest on the Bois
Loupart (inclusive).  The left of the attack will, in the
early stages, be held back on the high ground overlooking
Miraumont.
</p>

<p>
"(<i>b</i>) A western attack by the V. and XIII. Corps...."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 1st.</i>
</p>

<p>
4th, 5th, and 8th Brigades, 2nd and 3rd Divisions in
front line.  At 3.20 p.m. the Canadians attack a line
from Destremont Farm to the junction of the Courcelette
and Regina Trenches, thence the line of the Regina
Trench through Twenty-three Road to the Courcelette
Road and south to the Hessian Trench.
</p>

<p>
Our troops penetrate into this objective in certain
localities, but unable to maintain themselves.  The
5th Canadian Mounted Rifles on the left succeed in
bombing down Regina Trench nearly as far as the West
Miraumont Road, but a heavily-reinforced counter-attack
drives them back to Hessian Trench about 6 p.m.
However, our troops succeed in establishing a new
line from the Courcelette Trench across the Pys Road,
thence running north and north-east of the Practice
Trenches and across the Dyke Road to a junction with
the British Division on the Canadian right.  Kenora
Trench held to a few yards from Regina and posts
established forward in Courcelette Trench.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 2nd.</i>
</p>

<p>
Royal Flying Corps reports that the enemy is very
strong along Regina Trench on the west of the East
Miraumont Road.  Special reconnaissance ordered of
Regina Trench from the East Miraumont Road to the
Le Sars line.  Our troops very busy establishing the new
line and Regina Trench is shelled heavily by our artillery.
A new line ordered to be established from which
to attack Regina Trench between Courcelette Trench and
Below Trench.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 3rd.</i>
</p>

<p>
5th Brigade relieved by the 6th.  Our advanced post in
Kenora close to Regina Trench is abandoned temporarily
in order to allow the artillery a free hand.  A night
reconnaissance of Regina Trench produced little result
owing to the intense darkness.  Reserve Army decides
to postpone operations planned for Oct. 5th as more
time is required for artillery preparation.  Work is
actively continued on the new line in front of Regina
Trench in spite of the heavy rain.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 4th.</i>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
At 4.50 a.m. the 1st and 3rd Divisions attack the
German positions from Dyke Road around the Quadrilateral
(the intersection of Gallwitz Trench and support,
and Below Trench and support), thence along Regina
Trench to the Kenora communication between the
Grandcourt and Twenty-three Roads.  The two right
battalions reach their objectives and on the left the
7th and 9th Brigades gained a footing in the German
lines.  However, it is found impossible to hold the
positions against the vigorous counter-attacks of the
enemy, and after stubborn fighting the Canadians are
forced back to their jumping-off trenches.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 9th.</i>

front and support trenches from Twenty-three Road to
north of the North Practice Trenches, causing severe
damage to the trenches and somewhat heavy casualties.
Near the East Miraumont Road the Germans attempt an
attack from Regina Trench, but the barrage of the
2nd Divisional Artillery prevents them from leaving their
own parapet.  Parties of Germans driven by our artillery
fire from Regina Trench are caught on the Pys and
East Miraumont Road by our 18-pounders and engaged
with excellent effect.  Later on our artillery disperses
another large party near the Grandcourt Road.
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>
53rd British Infantry Brigade relieves 8th Brigade on
the left of the line.  Our heavy artillery directs an intense
fire upon Regina, Courcelette, Below, and Gallwitz
Trenches, doing a great deal of damage to the hostile
defences and causing many casualties.  The village of
Pys bombarded also, and many enemy observation
posts demolished.  A large party of Germans
observed near Achiet Trench and broken up by our
artillery fire.  Patrols from the 10th and 11th Brigades
examine wire in front of Regina Trench in spite of the
heavy bombardment.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 16th.</i>
</p>

<p>
Very satisfactory damage to the enemy's barbed wire
reported by the 4th Division patrols.  A quiet day for
the infantry, but our artillery silences several hostile

parallel to it.  The 10th Brigade to push forward its saps
towards Regina and co-operate with the 11th Brigade
with machine-gun fire.  The artillery active on both
sides, the enemy shelling the 10th Brigade front rather
heavily.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 18th.</i>
</p>

<p>
The arrangements for the offensive on the 19th
practically completed.  The 11th Brigade moves up to its
advanced headquarters in the North Practice Trenches,
and has a great deal of trouble establishing satisfactory
communications.  Artillery not very busy, though our
guns keep the enemy from repairing his damaged
defences.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 19th.</i>
</p>

<p>
A steady rain, making movement almost impossible
over the heavy ground.  The 2nd Army decides to postpone
the attack for twenty-four hours.  The 10th and 11th
Brigades working hard driving saps towards Regina
Trench and establishing jumping-off positions.  The
11th Brigade lines shelled heavily and continuously,
despite the retaliation of the Canadian artillery.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 20th.</i>
</p>

<p>
Operations postponed for a further twenty-four hours,
and the artillery takes advantage of the delay to
complete the demolition of the enemy's wire.  A quiet day
for the infantry, but the trenches are full of water and in
very bad condition, necessitating ceaseless work.  The
3rd Canadian Division leaves the Somme area.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 21st.</i>
</p>

<p>
Attack made about noon by the 11th Brigade, excellent
machine-gun work materially aiding a most successful
offensive.  The whole objective gained, and by
2 p.m. our men are busy consolidating the captured area.
Enemy massing near the Coulée Trench dispersed by our
artillery fire.  Further information received that the
Germans are concentrating near the Chalk pits east of the
Quadrilateral, and artillery and machine-gun barrages
redoubled and a counter-attack prevented.
</p>

</p>

<p>
No attempt made by the enemy to counter-attack during
the night, beyond a few bombing raids which were
easily repulsed.  The 10th Brigade to complete the
capture of Regina Trench.  The state of the front lines is
very bad and our men work under the most trying
conditions.  The enemy shell the captured areas heavily.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 23rd.</i>
</p>

<p>
Preparations for the Big Push in process of completion.

co-operate by pushing up the block in Regina Trench
eastwards.  Dyke Road heavily shelled.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 24th.</i>
</p>

<p>
The 10th Brigade reports that the 44th Battalion,
instructed to capture the remainder of Regina, is very
much exhausted by the severe conditions, and the minor
operation is postponed for twenty-four hours.  11th
Brigade patrols push their block in Regina another 120
yards eastwards.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 25th.</i>
</p>

<p>
At 7 a.m. the 44th Battalion attack the portion of
Regina Trench remaining in German hands&mdash;between
the Quadrilateral and the 11th Brigade block east of the
Pys Road&mdash;but meeting with very heavy enfilading
machine-gun fire from the Quadrilateral the men are
quite unable to reach their objective.  The 11th Brigade
have bombed eastwards from the block in Regina but
as the 44th Battalion do not arrive the Germans are
enabled to concentrate a strong bombing counter-attack
and drive our men back to their original post.  The
Corps decides to make this portion of the Regina Trench
part of the objective in the later operation.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>
The 12th Brigade relieves the 10th and 11th Brigades

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 28th.</i>
</p>

<p>
Enemy shelling vigorously in the area south of the
Albert-Bapaume Road.  The 78th Battalion sends out
patrols to locate new enemy lines.  The roads are very
bad, and great difficulty is experienced in transporting
the ammunition to the guns.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 29th.</i>
</p>

<p>
The bad weather prevents operations, but our artillery
and machine-gun barrages effectually prevent the
Germans from working on their new defences.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>
Gale blowing and artillery work hampered.  Operations
postponed until November 5th.  Heavy rain renders the
condition of the front trenches indescribable, and
frequent reliefs have to be made.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>October 31st.</i>
</p>

<p>
Weather improves, and the artillery fire becomes
general.  The enemy shell Albert, while our guns are

carried out.  Our guns succeed in capturing
Desire Trench from the Ravine to a point about halfway
between the Pys and East Miraumont Roads.  East of
this point our men have great trouble, meeting with heavy
artillery and machine-gun fire, and are ultimately driven
back to Regina Trench.  Parties from the 38th and 87th
Battalions advance into Grandcourt Trench and take
many prisoners, but later are ordered to retire and assist
in the consolidation of the new line running about 100
yards north of Desire Trench.  The operation as a whole
